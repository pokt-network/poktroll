# TODO_TECHDEBT(#137, #130): Once the `relayer.json` config file is implemented AND a local LLM RPC service
# is supported on LocalNet, this needs to be expanded to include more than one service. The ability to support
# multiple services is already in place but currently (as seen below) is hardcoded.
# TODO_UPNEXT(@okdas): this hostname should be updated to match that of the in-tilt anvil service.
