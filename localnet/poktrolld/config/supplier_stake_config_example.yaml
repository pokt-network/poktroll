# This file is used to stake a Supplier or update an existing Supplier's information in the Pocket Network.
# Pocket Network supports two types of staking mechanisms: custodial and non-custodial staking:
# * Custodial staking is the default mechanism, where the owner address (i.e., the account that
#   receives the rewards) is the same as the operator address (i.e., the address that operates
#   the Supplier).
# * Non-custodial staking is an advanced mechanism, where the owner address is different from
#   the operator address. This is useful to avoid overuse of the private key of the
#   account that owns the staked funds or receives the rewards.

# The address of the supplier's owner. This address could stake a new Supplier or
# update any of its properties excluding the operator address which is immutable.
# The account corresponding to this address could also unstake the Suppliers it owns.
# The owner address does not identify the Supplier in the Pocket Network; the same owner
# account can stake multiple Suppliers.

# The address of the operator of the Supplier. This address operates the Supplier,
# (i.e., signs relay responses, submits claims and proofs, updates service endpoints, etc.).
# This address can also used to stake a new Supplier or unstake an existing one.
# It uniquely identifies the Supplier in the Pocket Network and cannot be changed
# once the Supplier is created.
# The operator address is optional; if not provided, the owner address is used as
# the operator address.

# NB: The stake amount is exactly 1upokt greater than the value in genesis.json
# so that the stake command causes a state change.

  # The endpoint URL for the Anvil service is provided via the RelayMiner.
  # The RelayMiner acts as a proxy, forwarding requests to the actual Anvil data node behind it.
  # This setup allows for flexible and dynamic service provisioning within the network.
