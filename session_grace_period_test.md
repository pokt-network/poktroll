# Session Grace Period Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of session grace period logic in PATH to handle session rollovers smoothly and prevent the "Failed to receive any response from endpoints" error.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Extended FullNode Interface

Added new methods to the `FullNode` interface in `/Users/olshansky/workspace/pocket/path/protocol/shannon/protocol.go`:

- `GetSessionWithGracePeriod()` - Returns appropriate session considering grace period logic
- `GetSharedParams()` - Queries shared module parameters from blockchain
- `GetCurrentBlockHeight()` - Gets current block height for session validation

### 2. Core Logic

The grace period logic is implemented in both `LazyFullNode` and `CachingFullNode`:

**Key Algorithm:**

1. Fetch current session from cache/blockchain
2. Get shared parameters (grace period, blocks per session)
3. Get current block height
4. If within first 25% of new session AND previous session's grace period is still active:
   - Fetch and return previous session
5. Otherwise, return current session

**Grace Period Calculation:**

```
Previous Session End Height + GracePeriodEndOffsetBlocks >= Current Height
```

### 3. Session Usage Updated

Updated session fetching in:

- `mode_centralized.go:118` - Uses `GetSessionWithGracePeriod()` instead of `GetSession()`
- `mode_delegated.go:45` - Uses `GetSessionWithGracePeriod()` instead of `GetSession()`

### 4. Caching Strategy

- **Session data**: Cached with early refresh (75-90% of TTL)
- **Shared params**: Not cached (infrequent access)
- **Block height**: Not cached (frequent changes)
- **Previous sessions**: Fetched directly when needed (bypass cache for historical data)

## Benefits

### 1. Eliminates Session Rollover Failures

- During grace period, PATH continues using previous session's endpoints
- Prevents "no endpoints available" errors during transitions
- Smooth handoff between sessions

### 2. Blockchain-Aligned Timing

- Queries actual grace period from shared module parameters
- No hardcoded timeouts that drift from protocol timing
- Respects on-chain session configuration

### 3. Maintains Performance

- Leverages existing cache for current sessions
- Only fetches additional data when in grace period
- Graceful fallbacks if blockchain queries fail

## Testing Considerations

### Load Testing Scenarios

1. **Normal Operation**: Verify sessions work outside grace periods
2. **Grace Period Overlap**: Test behavior during first few blocks of new session
3. **Blockchain Failures**: Ensure fallbacks work when shared params/height queries fail
4. **Cache Timing**: Verify cache refresh aligns with session boundaries

### Validation Points

- Previous session returned only when grace period is active
- Current session returned when grace period has expired
- Proper error handling and fallbacks
- Logging provides visibility into grace period decisions

## Expected Impact on Load Testing

This implementation should resolve the session rollover issues you're experiencing by:

1. **Eliminating endpoint gaps** during 30-minute session transitions
2. **Reducing sanction cascades** caused by rollover timing issues
3. **Providing session continuity** during critical transition periods
4. **Aligning with protocol timing** instead of arbitrary cache TTLs

The grace period logic ensures that PATH maintains access to valid endpoints throughout session transitions, preventing the "Failed to receive any response from endpoints" error that occurs during rollovers.
