## 11/01/2023

### Changes

1. We're adding a 1 week `E2E Relay` iteration to focus solely on finishing off `Foundation` & `Integration` related work needed to enable automating end-to-end relays.
2. We've delayed the `Govern` iteration to next year because:
   - It is not a blocker for TestNetT
   - here are still open-ended questions from PNF that need to be addressed first.
3. We've introduced `TECHDEBT` iterations to tackle `TODOs` left throughout the code.
   - The first iteration will be focused on `TODO_BLOCKER` in the source code
   - Details to other iterations will be ironed out closer to the iteration.
4. We have decided to have multiple `Test` iterations, each of which will be focused on testing different components.
   - The first iteration will be focused on load testing relays to de-risk permissionless applications and verify the Claim & Proof lifecycle.
   - Details to each iteration will be ironed out closer to the iteration.
