# TODO_TECHDEBT: This file is called `0_tokenomics.feature` instead of
# `settlement.feature` to force it to run before other tests and ensure
# the correctness of the numbers asserted on. For example, if another test
# crates a Claim but doesn't wait for it to be settled, the numbers will be
# incorrect. A good long-term solution for this would be debug endpoints
# that can be used to clear the state of the chain between tests.


# TODO_TEST: Implement the following scenarios
# - Scenario: Supplier revenue shares are properly distributed
# - Scenario: TLM Mint=Burn when a valid claim is outside Max Limits
#   - Ensure over serviced event is submitted
# - Scenario: TLM GlobalMint properly distributes minted rewards to all actors
#   - Ensure reimbursement request is submitted
# - Scenario: Mint equals burn when a claim is created and a valid proof is submitted but not required
# - Scenario: No emissions or burn when a claim is created and an invalid proof is submitted
# - Scenario: No emissions or burn when a claim is created and a proof is required but is not submitted
# - Scenario: No emissions or burn when no claim is created

# TODO_UPNEXT(@bryanchriswhite): Add an E2E that includes validator delegation per the work implemented in #1755.
