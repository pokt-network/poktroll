# TODO_TECHDEBT: This file is called `0_settlement.feature` instead of
# `settlement.feature` to force it to run before other tests and ensure
# the corrctness of the numbers asserted on. For example, if another test
# crates a Claim but doesn't wait for it to be settled, the numbers will be
# incorrect. A good long-term solution for this would be debug endpoints
# that can be used to clear the state of the chain between tests.

Feature: Tokenomics Namespace
    Scenario: Settle the session when a valid claim is within max limits and a valid proof is submitted and required via threshold
        # Baseline
        Given the user has the pocketd binary installed

        And the service "anvil" registered for application "app1" has a compute units per relay of "1"

    #   - Ensure over serviced event is submitted
