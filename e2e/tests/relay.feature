Feature: Relay Namespace

    # NB: `make acc_initialize_pubkeys` must have been executed before this test is run
    Scenario: App can send a JSON-RPC relay to Supplier
        Given the user has the pocketd binary installed
        And the application "app1" is staked for service "anvil"
        And the supplier "supplier1" is staked for service "anvil"
        And the session for application "app1" and service "anvil" contains the supplier "supplier1"
        Then the application "app1" sends the supplier "supplier1" a successful request for service "anvil" with path "" and data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
        # This is necessary to ensure that the next test does not catch this relay
        # request's claim settlement.
        And a "tokenomics" module "ClaimSettled" end block event is broadcast

    # TODO_MAINNET(@red-0ne): Enable this test once PATH Gateway supports REST.
    # See https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/issues/87
    # Scenario: App can send a REST relay to Supplier
    #     Given the user has the pocketd binary installed
    #     # Account "app2" is staked for service "rest"
    #     And the application "app2" is staked for service "rest"
    #     And the supplier "supplier1" is staked for service "rest"
    #     And the session for application "app2" and service "rest" contains the supplier "supplier1"
    #    When the application "app2" sends the supplier "supplier1" a successful request for service "rest" with path "/quote"
    #    Then a "tokenomics" module "ClaimSettled" end block event is broadcast

    Scenario: App can send WebSocket relays to Supplier
        Given the user has the pocketd binary installed
        And the application "app3" is staked for service "anvilws"
        And the supplier "supplier1" is staked for service "anvilws"
        And the session for application "app3" and service "anvilws" contains the supplier "supplier1"
        # Establishing the websockets connection should be done when a session starts.
        # This is to maximize the number of responses before the session ends and the
        # websockets connection is closed.
        And the application "app3" establishes a websockets connection for service "anvilws"
        # TODO_CONSIDERATION: Consider expand these tests to count the number
        # of events sent over a websocket per the discussion here:
        # https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/pull/1099#discussion_r1978342620
        Then the application receives EVM subscription events until the session ends
        And the subscription is closed before claim window open height is reached
        And a "tokenomics" module "ClaimSettled" end block event is broadcast

    # TODO_TEST(@Olshansk):
    # - Successful relay through PATH's Trusted mode
    # - Successful relay through gateway app is delegation to
    # - Successful relay through gateway when app is delegating to multiple gateways
    # - Failed relay through gateway app is not delegation to
    # - Succeedful relays when using multiple suppliers for app in some session
    # - Error if app1 is not staked for svc1 but relay is sent
    # - Error if supplier is not staked for svc1 but relay is sent
    # - Error if claiming the session too early
    # - Error if proving the session too early
