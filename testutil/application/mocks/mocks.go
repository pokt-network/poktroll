package mocks

// This file is in place to declare the package for dynamically generated structs.
//
// Note that this does not follow the Cosmos SDK pattern of committing Mocks to main.
// For example, they commit auto-generate code to main: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/x/gov/testutil/expected_keepers_mocks.go
// Documentation on how Cosmos uses mockgen can be found here: https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/building-modules/testing#unit-tests
//
// IMPORTANT: We have attempted to use `.gitkeep` files instead, but it causes a circular dependency issue with protobuf and mock generation
// since we are leveraging `ignite` to compile `.proto` files which requires `.go` files to compile.
