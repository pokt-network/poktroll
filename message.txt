ðŸ“¢ Upgrade Notice ðŸ“¢

v0.1.28 is scheduled to go live tomorrow on 09/12/2025 at 9 AM PST at block height 287932.

ðŸ“Œ Looking ahead
- We'll be reducing upgrade frequency as the network matures.
- Longer buffer times will be provided before announcements & releases.

ðŸ’¬ Feedback for us
1. Do you prefer a heads-up before releases, or only post-upgrade notifications?
2. How much buffer time do you need between notification and upgrade?
3. Would you like more details on how we're improving network utility?
4. Anything else we can do to improve this process?
