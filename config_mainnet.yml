# Pocket Network Shadow MainNet Genesis Account Balances
#
# The values below amount to a total of 25M POKT for Pocket Network Shadow MainNet Genesis.
#
# They will be reconciled accordingly during the snapshot from Morse to Shannon.
#
# They are in place today to enable the launching of the new network, testing and onboarding
# of new validators, suppliers, and applications without being limited for faucet-like funds.
#
# Note that all inflation & deflation in the modules below is set to zero to mimic a burn=mint
# like network at maturity.

#
# Meta Note: If you are reading this and wondering "why are these numbers so large" or "why are these numbers so small",
# in reality, it doesn't matter. They will be reconciled through social consensus during the Morse -> Shannon
# snapshot event. For now, making them sufficiently large enables the development team to test, stress and iterate
# on the shadow mainnet without being limited by faucet-like funds.
#
# For example, imagine if a load test (before migration) identifies an onchain issue, causes a chain halt,
# leads to some lost keys, etc... There's no reason to be limited by operational overhead for issues like this
# given that funds will be reconciled during the snapshot event regardless.
