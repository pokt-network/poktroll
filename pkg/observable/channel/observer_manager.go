// 	  and is therefore not accessible here. If we move everything into the
//	  `observable` pkg so that the unexported member is in scope, then the channel
//	  pkg can't implement it for the same reason, it's an unexported method defined
//	  in a different pkg.
// 2. == is not defined for a generic Observer type. We would have to add an Equals()
// 	  to  the Observer interface.
