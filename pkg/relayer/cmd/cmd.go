RelayMiner architecture:

- Supplier: Onchain record advertising a service (e.g., ETH API)
- RelayMiner: Offchain coprocessor providing the service, proxying requests, validating relays, and ensuring rewards

Relay flow:

    +------+      +--------------+      +-----------------+
    | User | <--> |  RelayMiner  | <--> |   Backend API   |
    +------+      +--------------+      +-----------------+
                      |
                      v
                +----------------+
                |   Supplier     |
                | (onchain rec.) |
                +----------------+

Steps:
- User sends a relay request
- RelayMiner proxies, validates, signs, and forwards the request
- Backend API is the actual service (e.g., ETH node)
- Supplier is the onchain record the RelayMiner operates for

Benefits:
- Secure, auditable, and rewardable relays
- Clear separation between onchain identity (Supplier) and offchain execution (RelayMiner)

For help, run: relayminer --help
`,
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			_ = cmd.Help()
		},
	}

	cmd.AddCommand(startCmd())
	cmd.AddCommand(relayCmd())
	return cmd
