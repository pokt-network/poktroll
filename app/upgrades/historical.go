package upgrades

// This file is intended to keep old, historical upgrades in one place. It is advised to keep the future upgrades in the
// separate file, and then move them to `historical.go` after a successful upgrade so the new nodes can still sync from
// the genesis.

// TODO_TECHDEBT(@okdas): after we verify `State Sync` is fully functional, we can hypothetically remove old upgrades from
// the codebase, as the nodes won't have to execute upgrades and will download the "snapshot" instead. Some other
// blockchain networks do that (such as `evmos`: https://github.com/evmos/evmos/tree/main/app/upgrades).
// Note that this may inhibit a full state sync from genesis.
