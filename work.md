üéØ Common Data Points Needed

For all workflows, we'd need access to:

- Historical Claims: Session details, compute units, settlement amounts
- Proof Submissions: Success rates, timing, penalties
- Parameter History: Network parameter changes over time
- Token Flows: Mints, burns, transfers by reason/module
- Stake Movements: Staking, unstaking, slashing events
- Service Metrics: Relay counts, quality scores, pricing
- Network State: Active participants, session assignments

These workflows address the core questions of "How much did I make?", "How much should I make?", and "How can I optimize my participation?" while providing actionable insights for
different types of network participants.

Someone comes and asks:

- How much money did I make?
- How much money should I make?
- How many claims did I submit?
- How many proofs did I submit?

1. Provide an operator address
2. Find all of their claims
3. Find all of the proofs
4. Then either:

- Drill down into one
- Sum across all

5. Need to compare actual vs estimated

- Global multiplier
- Relay Mining difficulty

‚è∫ Based on my analysis of the tokenomics module, here are the critical things you need to address:

üö® MAINNET_MIGRATION Critical TODOs:

1. Low-Volume Exploit (keeper/token_logic_modules.go:83-87)

   - Claims with zero compute units can get rewards
   - Security vulnerability that must be fixed

2. Application Zero-Stake Handling (keeper/token_logic_modules.go:229-234)

   - Need to unstake applications when their stake drops to zero
   - Could leave apps in inconsistent state

3. Supplier Slashing Proportionality (keeper/settle_pending_claims.go:706-707)

   - Must implement proportional slashing based on supplier stake
   - Currently not slashing correctly

4. Settlement Atomicity (keeper/settle_pending_claims.go:210-211)

   - Settlement operations need better transaction guarantees
   - Could fail partially

5. Floating-Point Precision (types/params.go:185-187)

   - Using float64 for mint allocations instead of big.Rat
   - Will cause tokenomics drift over time

üîç Critical Implementation Gaps:

1. Root.Count vs Root.Sum Confusion

   - Using numRelays instead of numComputeUnits for calculations
   - Affects accurate tokenomics calculations

2. Missing Validations:

   - No upper bound on GlobalInflationPerClaim
   - No overflow checks in token calculations
   - Edge cases when app stake equals minimum

3. Race Condition Risk

   - Force-unstaked suppliers may still interact with system
   - Noted in keeper/settle_pending_claims.go:495-500

üìù Implementation Checklist:

- Fix zero compute units exploit
- Implement app unstaking on zero balance
- Add proportional supplier slashing
- Make settlement operations atomic
- Replace float64 with big.Rat for allocations
- Add parameter validation bounds
- Handle supplier unbonding race condition
- Fix root.Count/Sum confusion post-mainnet

The module structure is solid, but these security and precision issues must be resolved before mainnet deployment.
