          # Critical consensus-related functions to monitor:
          #
          # PrepareProposal:
          #   Prepares a block proposal by selecting transactions to include in the block.
          #   A change here could affect what transactions are included in a block.
          #
          # ProcessProposal:
          #   Validates block proposals against consensus rules.
          #   Changes in this function could lead to consensus validation issues.
          #
          # FinalizeBlock:
          #   Finalizes the block by applying the transactions.
          #   This function is critical in ensuring that the block reaches consensus.
          #
          # Commit:
          #   Commits the application state after the block has been processed.
          #   Any changes here could impact state transitions and consensus.
          #
          # VerifyVoteExtension:
          #   Verifies extended votes in the consensus process (Tendermint).
          #   Any changes could directly impact vote verification in consensus.
          #
          # ExtendVote:
          #   Adds vote extensions in the consensus process (Tendermint).
          #   Modifies how votes are extended, critical in consensus mechanics.
          #
          # Less-critical but related functions to monitor:
          #
          # CheckTx:
          #   Validates transactions in the mempool. While not part of the core consensus,
          #   changes here can affect what gets included in blocks, which indirectly impacts consensus.
          #
          # InitChain:
          #   Called during chain initialization. Important for network upgrades or starting a new chain.
          #
          # StoreConsensusParams:
          #   Stores consensus parameters in the chain state.
          #   Changes here could affect how consensus parameters are handled or updated.
          #
          # SimDeliver:
          #   Simulates transaction delivery for gas estimation and simulation. Not directly involved in consensus,
          #   but changes here could affect how transactions are simulated and processed before being included in a block.
          #
          # SimTxFinalizeBlock:
          #   Simulates a finalized block for testing and debugging purposes.
          #   Less critical, but could be monitored for changes that may affect testing and simulation behavior.
