## Type of change

Select one or more:

- [ ] New feature, functionality or library
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] Code health or cleanup
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Other (specify)

## Testing

- [ ] **Run all unit tests**: `make go_develop_and_test`
- [ ] **Run E2E tests locally**: `make test_e2e`
- [ ] **Run E2E tests on DevNet**: Add the `devnet-test-e2e` label to the PR. This is VERY expensive, only do it after all the reviews are complete.
