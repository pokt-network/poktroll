# Telegram Broadcast Bot

This document describes how to trigger the Telegram broadcast bot for sending announcements to Pocket Network stakeholders.

## Overview

The Telegram bot is a notification system used to broadcast important announcements (e.g., network upgrades, releases) to multiple Telegram groups simultaneously, including exchange partners and community channels.

## Bot Modes

The bot operates in two distinct modes:

### 1. Test Mode
Sends messages **only** to the testing group for validation before production broadcasts.

- **Target**: Pocket Network Bot Testing Group (single group)
- **Purpose**: Verify message formatting and content before full broadcast
- **Safety**: No risk of incorrect announcements to external partners

### 2. Full Mode (Production)
Sends messages to **all configured groups** including exchange partners and community channels.

- **Targets**: 18 Telegram groups including:
  - Exchange partner channels (BitGet, ByBit, CoinEx, Gate.io, Kraken, KuCoin, etc.)
  - Community channels (The Poktopus Den)
  - Internal testing group
- **Purpose**: Official announcements and critical updates
- **Caution**: Messages reach external stakeholders immediately

## Triggering the Bot

### Method 1: Using Makefile Commands (Recommended)

#### Test Broadcast
```bash
make telegram_test_broadcast_msg MSG_FILE=path/to/message.txt
```

**Example:**
```bash
make telegram_test_broadcast_msg MSG_FILE=announcements/upgrade_notice.txt
```

#### Production Broadcast
```bash
make telegram_broadcast_msg MSG_FILE=path/to/message.txt
```

**Example:**
```bash
make telegram_broadcast_msg MSG_FILE=announcements/mainnet_release.html
```

### Method 2: Using GitHub Actions Workflow

#### Via GitHub Web UI
1. Navigate to **Actions** tab in the repository
2. Select **"Telegram Broadcast"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Message**: Enter your announcement text (supports HTML formatting)
   - **Test mode**: Check the box to send only to testing group
5. Click **"Run workflow"** to trigger

#### Via GitHub CLI
```bash
# Test broadcast
gh workflow run telegram-broadcast.yml \
  -f message="<b>Test Announcement</b><br>This is a test message." \
  -f test_mode=true

# Production broadcast
gh workflow run telegram-broadcast.yml \
  -f message="<b>Official Announcement</b><br>Network upgrade scheduled for..." \
  -f test_mode=false
```

## Message Formatting

Messages support **HTML formatting** for rich text:

### Supported HTML Tags
- `<b>text</b>` - **Bold text**
- `<i>text</i>` - *Italic text*
- `<u>text</u>` - Underlined text
- `<code>text</code>` - Monospace code
- `<pre>text</pre>` - Preformatted code block
- `<a href="url">text</a>` - Hyperlinks
- `<br>` - Line break

## Sample Messages

Below are sample messages for different broadcast scenarios. You can save these to files and use them as templates.

**How to use:**
```bash
# Test first
make telegram_test_broadcast_msg MSG_FILE=routine-update.html

# After verification, broadcast to production
make telegram_broadcast_msg MSG_FILE=routine-update.html
```

## Best Practices

### Before Broadcasting

1. **Always test first**: Run test mode to verify formatting and content
   ```bash
   make telegram_test_broadcast_msg MSG_FILE=announcement.html
   ```

2. **Review in testing group**: Check the message appearance in the test channel

3. **Verify links and formatting**: Ensure all URLs work and HTML renders correctly

4. **Get team approval**: Have announcements reviewed before production broadcast

### Production Broadcasting

1. **Double-check message file**: Ensure you're using the correct, approved message file

2. **Verify mode**: Make sure you're NOT in test mode for production broadcasts

3. **Send once**: Avoid duplicate broadcasts - messages cannot be recalled

4. **Monitor delivery**: Check a few target groups to confirm successful delivery

### Safety Guidelines

- **Test mode is mandatory** for all new message formats
- **Never broadcast untested content** to production groups
- **Coordinate with team** before sending to exchange partners
- **Time broadcasts appropriately** considering global time zones
- **Keep messages professional** - they represent Pocket Network to partners

### Implementation Files

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/telegram-broadcast.yml` - Manual trigger interface
- **Core Logic**: `.github/workflows/telegram-send-message.yml` - Message sending implementation
- **Makefile**: `makefiles/telegram.mk` - CLI commands for broadcasting

## Troubleshooting

### Message not delivered
- **Check workflow logs**: View GitHub Actions logs for error messages
- **Verify message format**: Ensure HTML is valid (unclosed tags cause failures)
- **File path**: Confirm `MSG_FILE` path is correct and file exists

### HTML not rendering
- **Use supported tags only**: Refer to the formatting section above
- **Escape special characters**: Use HTML entities for `<`, `>`, `&` in content
- **Test mode first**: Always verify rendering in test group before production

### Wrong groups received message
- **Check test mode flag**: Verify `test_mode` parameter value
- **Review workflow run**: Check GitHub Actions run to see which workflow executed
