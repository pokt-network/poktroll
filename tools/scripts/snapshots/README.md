This is internal tooling for creating and distributing snapshots of the Poktroll blockchain.

- `create_snapshot.sh` - Creates a new snapshot of the blockchain.
- `index.html` - A simple HTML page for browsing and downloading the snapshots.
- `index_with_pruned.html` - A version of the page that includes a link to the pruned snapshot. They are currently not used, but this version is kept so we can switch back when the pruned snapshots are available.
