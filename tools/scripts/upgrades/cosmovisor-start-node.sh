This script runs the full node using cosmovisor and performs an upgrade after the upgrade plan is submitted on chain.
It simulates a real network upgrade. For consensus-breaking changes, ensure the 'old' binary doesn't have these changes.

Pre-requisites:
1. 'Old' binary
2. 'New' binary
3. Cosmovisor (Install: 'go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.5.0')
   Documentation: https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor
4. \`upgrade.Upgrade\` with matching \`POCKETD_UPGRADE_PLAN_NAME\` created and included in the new version
5. LocalNet turned off

# Define paths and upgrade name
POCKETD_OLD_BINARY_PATH=$HOME/pocket/pocket-for-releases/pocketd
POCKETD_NEW_BINARY_PATH=$HOME/pocket/pocket/pocketd
POCKETD_UPGRADE_PLAN_NAME=v0.0.4

cat <<EOF

The script will use the following:
Old binary: $POCKETD_OLD_BINARY_PATH
New binary: $POCKETD_NEW_BINARY_PATH
Upgrade plan name: $POCKETD_UPGRADE_PLAN_NAME
