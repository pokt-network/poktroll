// Package telemetry provides a set of functions for incrementing counters which track
// various events across the codebase. Typically, calls to these counter functions SHOULD
// be made inside deferred anonymous functions so that they will reference the final values
// of their inputs. Any instrumented piece of code which contains branching logic with respect
// its counter function inputs is subject to this constraint (i.e. MUST defer).
