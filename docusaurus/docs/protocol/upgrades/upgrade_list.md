### Syncing from genesis - manual steps
<!-- TODO(@okdas): when the next cosmovisor version released with `https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/21790` included - provide automated solution (csv file + pre-downloaded binaries) that will add hot-fixes automatically, allowing to sync from block #1 without any intervention -->

When syncing Alpha TestNet from the first block, the node will fail at height `46329`. Some manual steps are required in order for it to continue. Please [follow manual upgrade instructions](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/tag/v0.0.9-4).
