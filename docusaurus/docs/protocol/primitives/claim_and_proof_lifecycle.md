## Introduction

The `Claim & Proof` lifecycle is a fundamental part of the Pocket Network protocol.

At a high-level, it is an adaptation of a well-known `commit & reveal` paradigm used
in various blockchain application such as [ENS](https://docs.ens.domains/contract-api-reference/.eth-permanent-registrar/controller).

:::note

For the purpose of explaining the `Claim & Proof` lifecycle, we will remove
`Gateways` from the discussion and assume that `Applications` are directly
interacting with the `Suppliers`.

        PN -->> S: Increase account balance (emission)
        PN -->> A: Deduct staked balance (burn)
    end
```

## Session

A session is a necessary pre-requisite for the `Claim & Proof` lifecycle to work.
See [Session](./session.md) for more details.

### Session Duration

After a session is initiated, the majority of it is handled `off-chain`,
as `Applications` make RPC requests (`relays`) to the `Supplier`.

### Session End

After a session ends, the Claim & Proof Lifecycle can be decomposed, at a high-level,
into the following steps.

```mermaid
timeline
    title Post Session Proof Validation
    Session Ends <br> (Protocol)
        : Recompute SMST root & sum (compute units)
        : Flush and store SMST to local disk
    CreateClaim <br> (Supplier)
        : Wait for Claim Window to open
        : Submit CreateClaim Transaction <br>(root, sum, session, app, supplier, service, etc...)
        : Claim stored on-chain
    SubmitProof <br> (Supplier)
        : Wait for Proof Window to open
        : Retrieve seed (entropy) from on-chain data (block hash)
        : Generate Merkle Proof for path in SMST based on seed
        : Submit SubmitProof Transaction <br>(session, merkle proof, leaf, etc...)
        : Proof stored on-chain
    Proof Validation <br> (Protocol)
        : Retrieve on-chain Claims that need to be settled
        : Retrieve corresponding on-chain Proof for every Claim
        : Validate leaf difficulty
        : Validate Merkle Proof
        : Validate Leaf Signature
        : Burn Application Stake proportional to sum
        : Inflate Supplier Balance  proportional to sum
```

## Claim

A `Claim` is a structure submitted on-chain by a `Supplier` claiming to have done
some amount of work in servicing `relays` for `Application`.

Exactly one claim exists for every `(Application, Supplier, Session)`.

A `Claim` forces a `Supplier` to commit to have done `sum` work during a `Session` for
a certain `Application`. The `sum` in the root of the SMST is the amount of work
done. Each leaf has a different `weight` depending on the number of _"compute units"_
that were necessary to service that request.

_TODO_DOCUMENT(@Olshansk): Link to a document on compute units once it it written._

### Claim Protobuf

A serialized version of the `Claim` is stored on-chain.

You can find the definition for the [Claim structure here](../../../proto/poktroll/proof/claim.proto).

### CreateClaim Transaction

A `CreateClaim` transaction can be submitted by a `Supplier` to store a claim `on-chain`.

You can find the definition for the [CreateClaim Transaction here](../../../proto/poktroll/proof/tx.proto).

### CreateClaim Validation

_TODO(@bryanchriswhite, @Olshansk): Update this section once [msg_server_create_claim.go](./../../../x/proof/keeper/msg_server_create_claim.go) is fully implemented._

### Claim Window

After a `Session` ends, a `Supplier` has several blocks, a `Claim Window`, to submit
a `CreateClaim` transaction containing a `Claim`. If it is submitted too early
or too late, it will be rejected by the protocol.

If a `Supplier` fails to submit a `Claim` during the Claim Window, it will forfeit
any potential rewards it could earn in exchange for the work done.

_TODO(@Olshansk): Link to the governance params governing this once implemented._

## Proof

A `Proof` is a structure submitted on-chain by a `Supplier` containing a Merkle
Proof to a single pseudo-randomly selected leaf from the corresponding `Claim`.

At most one `Proof` exists for every `Claim`.

A `Proof` is necessary for the `Claim` to be validated so the `Supplier` can be
rewarded for the work done.

_TODO_DOCUMENT(@Olshansk): Link to a document on compute units once it it written._

### Proof Protobuf

A serialized version of the `Proof` is stored on-chain.

You can find the definition for the [Proof structure here](../../../proto/poktroll/proof/proof.proto)

### SubmitProof Transaction

A `SubmitProof` transaction can be submitted by a `Supplier` to store a proof `on-chain`.

If the `Proof` is invalid, or if there is no corresponding `Claim` for the `Proof`, the
transaction will be rejected.

You can find the definition for the [SubmitProof Transaction here](../../../proto/poktroll/proof/tx.proto).

### SubmitProof Validation

_TODO(@bryanchriswhite, @Olshansk): Update this section once [msg_server_submit_proof.go](./../../../x/proof/keeper/msg_server_submit_proof.go) is fully implemented._

### Proof Window

After the `Proof Window` opens, a `Supplier` has several blocks, a `Proof Window`,
to submit a `SubmitProof` transaction containing a `Proof`. If it is submitted too
early or too late, it will be rejected by the protocol.

If a `Supplier` fails to submit a `Proof` during the Proof Window, the Claim will
expire and it it will forfeit any previously claimed work done.

_TODO(@Olshansk): Link to the governance params governing this once implemented._

## Proof Security

In addition to basic validation as part of processing `SubmitProof` to determine
whether or not the `Proof` should be stored on-chain, there are several additional
deep cryptographic validations needed:

1. `Merkle Leaf Validation`: Proof of the off-chain `Supplier`/`Application` interaction during the Relay request & response.
2. `Merkle Proof Selection`: Proof of the amount of work done by the `Supplier` during the `Session`.

:::note

TODO: Link to tokenomics and data integrity checks for discussion once they are written.

:::

### Merkle Leaf Validation

The key components of every leaf in the `Sparse Merkle Sum Trie` are shown below.

After the leaf is validated, two things happen:

1. The stake of `Application` signing the `Relay Request` is decreased through burn
2. The account balance of the `Supplier` signing the `Relay Response` is increased through mint

The validation on these signatures is done on-chain as part of `Proof Validation`.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Sparse Merkle Sum Trie Leaf
        subgraph Metadata
            S["Session"]
            W["Weight (compute units)"]
        end
        subgraph Signed Relay Request
            direction TB
            Req[Relay Request Data]
            AppSig(ApplicationSignature)
            AppSig o-.-o Req
        end

        subgraph Signed Relay Response
            direction TB
            Res[Relay Response Data]
            SupSig(SupplierSignature)
            SupSig o-.-o Res
        end
    end
```

### Merkle Proof Selection

Before the leaf itself is validated, we need to make sure if there is a valid
Merkle Proof for the associated pseudo-random path computed on-chain.

Since the path that needs to be proven uses an on-chain seed after the `Claim`
has been submitted, it is impossible to know the path in advance.

Assume a collision resistant hash function `H` that takes a the `block header hash`
as the `seed` and maps it to a `path` in the `Merkle Trie` key space.

#### Example: Example Sparse Merkle Sum Trie (SMST)

Below is an example of a `Sparse Merkle Sum Trie` where the paths can be at
most `5` bits (for example purposes).
