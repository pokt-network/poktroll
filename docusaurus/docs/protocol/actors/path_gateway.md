## Overview

`PATH Gateway` is responsible for relaying requests between a client dApp
(e.g. mobile app, web app, etc...) and the [Supplier](./supplier.md)s on Pocket
Network, handling all intermediary business logic.

A [Gateway](./gateway.md) operator or a sovereign [Application](./application.md)
interested in accessing Pocket Network directly would need to run a `PATH Gateway`
or custom software that implements the same functionality.

## Configuration

Configurations and additional documentation related to operating a `PATH Gateway`
can be found at [path_gateway.md](https://path.grove.city/operate).
