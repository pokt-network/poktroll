## Parameters


|Module | Field Type | Field Name |Comment |
|-------|------------|------------|--------|| `application` | `uint64    ` | `max_delegated_gateways` | max_delegated_gateways defines the maximum number of gateways that a single application can delegate to. This is used to prevent performance issues in case the relay ring signature becomes too large. |
| `proof     ` | `bytes     ` | `relay_difficulty_target_hash` | TODO_FOLLOWUP(@olshansk, #690): Either delete this or change it to be named "minimum" relay_difficulty_target_hash is the maximum value a relay hash must be less than to be volume/reward applicable. |
| `proof     ` | `float     ` | `proof_request_probability` | proof_request_probability is the probability of a session requiring a proof if it's cost (i.e. compute unit consumption) is below the ProofRequirementThreshold. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `num_blocks_per_session` | num_blocks_per_session is the number of blocks between the session start & end heights. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `grace_period_end_offset_blocks` | grace_period_end_offset_blocks is the number of blocks, after the session end height, during which the supplier can still service payable relays. Suppliers will need to recreate a claim for the previous session (if already created) to get paid for the additional relays. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `claim_window_open_offset_blocks` | claim_window_open_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the session grace period height, at which the claim window opens. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `claim_window_close_offset_blocks` | claim_window_close_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the claim window open height, at which the claim window closes. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `proof_window_open_offset_blocks` | proof_window_open_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the claim window close height, at which the proof window opens. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `proof_window_close_offset_blocks` | proof_window_close_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the proof window open height, at which the proof window closes. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `supplier_unbonding_period_sessions` | supplier_unbonding_period_sessions is the number of sessions that a supplier must wait after unstaking before their staked assets are moved to their account balance. On-chain business logic requires, and ensures, that the corresponding block count of the unbonding period will exceed the end of any active claim & proof lifecycles. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `application_unbonding_period_sessions` | application_unbonding_period_sessions is the number of sessions that an application must wait after unstaking before their staked assets are moved to their account balance. On-chain business logic requires, and ensures, that the corresponding block count of the application unbonding period will exceed the end of its corresponding proof window close height. |
| `shared    ` | `uint64    ` | `compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier` | The amount of upokt that a compute unit should translate to when settling a session. DEV_NOTE: This used to be under x/tokenomics but has been moved here to avoid cyclic dependencies. |
