## Parameters


|Module | Field Type | Field Name |Comment |
|-------|------------|------------|--------|
| `application` | `uint64` | `max_delegated_gateways` | max_delegated_gateways defines the maximum number of gateways that a single application can delegate to. This is used to prevent performance issues in case the relay ring signature becomes too large. |
| `application` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | `min_stake` | min_stake is the minimum stake in upokt that an application must have to remain staked. |
| `gateway` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | `min_stake` | min_stake is the minimum amount of uPOKT that a gateway must stake. |
| `proof` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | `proof_missing_penalty` | proof_missing_penalty is the number of tokens (uPOKT) which should be slashed from a supplier when a proof is required (either via proof_requirement_threshold or proof_missing_penalty) but is not provided. TODO_MAINNET: Consider renaming this to `proof_missing_penalty_upokt`. |
| `proof` | `float` | `proof_request_probability` | proof_request_probability is the probability of a session requiring a proof if it's cost (i.e. compute unit consumption) is below the ProofRequirementThreshold. |
| `proof` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | `proof_requirement_threshold` | proof_requirement_threshold is the session cost (i.e. compute unit consumption) threshold which asserts that a session MUST have a corresponding proof when its cost is equal to or above the threshold. This is in contrast to the this requirement being determined probabilistically via ProofRequestProbability.  TODO_MAINNET: Consider renaming this to `proof_requirement_threshold_upokt`. |
| `proof` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | `proof_submission_fee` | proof_submission_fee is the number of tokens (uPOKT) which should be paid by the supplier operator when submitting a proof. This is needed to account for the cost of storing proofs on-chain and prevent spamming (i.e. sybil bloat attacks) the network with non-required proofs. TODO_MAINNET: Consider renaming this to `proof_submission_fee_upokt`. |
| `service` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | `add_service_fee` | The amount of uPOKT required to add a new service. This will be deducted from the signer's account balance, and transferred to the pocket network foundation. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `application_unbonding_period_sessions` | application_unbonding_period_sessions is the number of sessions that an application must wait after unstaking before their staked assets are moved to their account balance. On-chain business logic requires, and ensures, that the corresponding block count of the application unbonding period will exceed the end of its corresponding proof window close height. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `claim_window_close_offset_blocks` | claim_window_close_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the claim window open height, at which the claim window closes. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `claim_window_open_offset_blocks` | claim_window_open_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the session grace period height, at which the claim window opens. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier` | The amount of upokt that a compute unit should translate to when settling a session. DEV_NOTE: This used to be under x/tokenomics but has been moved here to avoid cyclic dependencies. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `grace_period_end_offset_blocks` | grace_period_end_offset_blocks is the number of blocks, after the session end height, during which the supplier can still service payable relays. Suppliers will need to recreate a claim for the previous session (if already created) to get paid for the additional relays. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `num_blocks_per_session` | num_blocks_per_session is the number of blocks between the session start & end heights. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `proof_window_close_offset_blocks` | proof_window_close_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the proof window open height, at which the proof window closes. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `proof_window_open_offset_blocks` | proof_window_open_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the claim window close height, at which the proof window opens. |
| `shared` | `uint64` | `supplier_unbonding_period_sessions` | supplier_unbonding_period_sessions is the number of sessions that a supplier must wait after unstaking before their staked assets are moved to their account balance. On-chain business logic requires, and ensures, that the corresponding block count of the unbonding period will exceed the end of any active claim & proof lifecycles. |
| `supplier` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | `min_stake` | min_stake is the minimum amount of uPOKT that a supplier must stake to be included in network sessions and remain staked. |
