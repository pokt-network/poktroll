title: Mint=Burn TLM
sidebar_position: 5

_tl;dr The transfer of tokens from the applications to the suppliers based on the amount of work received and provided respectively._

The `Mint=Burn` TLM is, _theoretically_, the only TLM necessary once the network
reaches maturity in the far future.

The same number of tokens minted across all protocol participants is burned from
the **Application module**. The stake (in escrow) owned by the application which is
paying for work is reduced and the rewards are distributed according to the
`MintEqualsBurnClaimDistribution` parameters to suppliers, proposers, service source
owners, and the DAO.

## MintEqualsBurnClaimDistribution Parameters

The `MintEqualsBurnClaimDistribution` parameters control how the settlement amount is distributed across different network participants:

- **`dao`**: Percentage of settlement amount sent to the DAO reward address
- **`proposer`**: Percentage of settlement amount sent to the block proposer (validator)
- **`supplier`**: Percentage of settlement amount sent to suppliers (distributed among revenue shareholders)
- **`source_owner`**: Percentage of settlement amount sent to the service source owner
- **`application`**: Percentage of settlement amount that remains with the application (typically 0 for mint=burn)

These percentages must sum to 1.0 (100%) to ensure all settlement tokens are properly distributed.

### Default Distribution

The default distribution percentages are:
- **DAO**: 10% (0.1)
- **Proposer**: 5% (0.05)
- **Supplier**: 70% (0.7)
- **Source Owner**: 15% (0.15)
- **Application**: 0% (0.0)

### Parameter Governance

This parameter can be updated through governance proposals using the `MsgUpdateParams` message. All distribution percentages must be non-negative and sum to exactly 1.0.
