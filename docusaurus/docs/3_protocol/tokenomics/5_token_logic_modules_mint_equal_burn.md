## TLM: Mint=Burn (MEB)

_tl;dr The transfer of tokens from the applications to the suppliers based on the amount of work received and provided respectively._

The `Mint=Burn` TLM is, _theoretically_, the only TLM necessary once the network
reaches maturity in the far future.

The same number of tokens minted to the **Supplier module** is burned from
the **Application module**. The stake (in escrow) owned by the application which is
paying for work is reduced and the rewards are distributed to the suppliers and their
revenue shareholder addresses.

TODO_MAINNET: If the application stake has dropped to (near?) zero, should
we unstake it? Should we use it's balance? Should their be a payee of last resort?
Make sure to document whatever decision we come to.

### TLM: Distributed Settlement

_tl;dr Distribute the application settlement amount according to onchain allocation percentages instead of giving everything to the supplier._

The `Distributed Settlement` feature provides an alternative to the traditional Mint=Burn behavior when global inflation is disabled (`global_inflation_per_claim = 0`). Instead of suppliers receiving 100% of the settlement amount, the tokens are distributed among all stakeholders according to the governance-defined claim settlement distribution percentages.

### Configuration

This feature is automatically activated when `global_inflation_per_claim = 0` and uses the `claim_settlement_distribution` governance parameter to determine how to split the settlement amount:

- **When `global_inflation_per_claim > 0`**: Traditional global mint behavior with mint allocation percentages
- **When `global_inflation_per_claim = 0`**: Distributed settlement using claim settlement distribution percentages

### Distributed Settlement Flow

When `global_inflation_per_claim = 0`:

1. **Settlement Amount Calculation**: Same as traditional Mint=Burn - based on work done
2. **Percentage Distribution**: Settlement amount is split according to `claim_settlement_distribution`:
   - **Supplier**: 70% (distributed to supplier and revenue shareholders)
   - **DAO**: 10% (sent to DAO reward address)
   - **Proposer**: 5% (sent to block proposer)
   - **Source Owner**: 15% (sent to service owner)
   - **Application**: 0% (can be configured if needed)
3. **Application Burn**: Application stake decreases by the full settlement amount (unchanged)

### Key Differences from Global Mint

| Aspect                   | Global Mint TLM                      | Distributed Settlement               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Total Token Supply**   | Increases (new tokens minted)        | Unchanged (no new minting)           |
| **Activation Condition** | `global_inflation_per_claim > 0`     | `global_inflation_per_claim = 0`     |
| **Application Cost**     | Settlement + inflation reimbursement | Settlement only                      |
| **Supplier Reward**      | 100% of settlement + inflation share | Percentage of settlement (e.g., 70%) |

### Use Cases

**Distributed Settlement is ideal when:**

- Network wants to transition away from inflationary tokenomics
- Desire to maintain stakeholder rewards without increasing token supply
- Applications prefer predictable costs without inflation surcharges

**Traditional Mint=Burn is ideal when:**

- Simplified tokenomics with suppliers receiving full settlement
- Global inflation is active for network growth incentives

:::note

The distributed settlement feature enables governance to experiment with non-inflationary reward distribution while maintaining the existing mint allocation percentages structure. This provides a bridge between inflationary and deflationary tokenomics models.
