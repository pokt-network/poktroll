## Background on Optimistic Relay Accumulation

RelayMiner's accumulate relay rewards **before** the relay is forwarded to the backend.

This optimistic approach:

- Counts the relay immediately
- Enables _in-process_ rate-limiting (no extra network calls)
- Protects suppliers against over-servicing flood attacks

### Managing 5xx Rewards

1. Before a relay is forwarded to the backend, the relay miner accumulates the reward.
2. If the backend replies with a `5xx` status, the relay miner immediately reverts the reward.
3. If the backend replies with a `2xx` or `3xx` status, the relay miner keeps the reward.
4. This ensures that suppliers are not paid for failed relays, while rate-limiting remains effective against burst traffic.

## Rate Limiting with Optimistic Accumulation

The following diagram shows the optimistic accumulation of rewards:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant App as Application
   participant Miner as Relay Miner
   participant Backend as Backend Service

   App->>+Miner: Relay #1
   Note over Miner: Accumulate reward (optimistic)
   Miner->>+Backend: Forward Relay #1

   App->>+Miner: Relay #2
   Note over Miner: Accumulate reward (optimistic)
   Miner->>+Backend: Forward Relay #2

   App->>+Miner: Relay #3
   Note over Miner: Rate limit reached → reject
```

### Pessimistic Reversal of 5xx Rewards

The following diagram shows the pessimistic reversal of rewards for 5xx responses:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Relay Path
        A[Receive relay request] --> B(Accumulate reward<br/>+ rate-limit check)
        B --> C[Forward to backend]
        C --> D{HTTP status}
        D -- < 500 --> E[Mark relay successful]
        E --> F[Return response to client]

        D -- ≥ 500 --> G[Revert reward]
        G --> H[Return 5xx to client]
    end
```
