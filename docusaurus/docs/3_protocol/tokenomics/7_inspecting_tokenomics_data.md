:::warning Work in Progress
This document is a work-in-progress guide for analyzing tokenomics data. It provides workflows and data requirements for different stakeholder types. Implementation details and specific queries will be added as tooling develops.
:::

## Overview <!-- omit in toc -->

This guide helps network participants understand:

1. **What workflow** they need to evaluate their tokenomics data
2. **What events and parameters** they need to collect
3. **Where to find** the relevant information in the protocol
4. **How to interpret** the results for their specific use case

## Stakeholder Workflows

### üèóÔ∏è Supplier/Operator Workflows

#### 1. Revenue Analysis & Optimization

**Question**: "How can I maximize my earnings?"

**Required Data:**

- Supplier operator address
- Claims submitted, settled, and expired
- Proof submission rates and success rates
- Settlement amounts by session and service
- Current stake amount and revenue share configuration

**Events to Monitor:**

- `EventClaimCreated` - Track claims submitted
- `EventClaimSettled` - Track successful settlements
- `EventClaimExpired` - Track expired claims
- `EventProofSubmitted` - Track proof submissions
- `EventProofUpdated` - Track proof updates
- `EventSupplierSlashed` - Track slashing events

**Parameters:**

- `mint_equals_burn_claim_distribution` - Supplier allocation percentage
- `global_inflation_per_claim` - Additional inflation rewards
- `compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier` - Conversion rate
- Service-specific `compute_units_per_relay` - Service pricing

**Analysis Workflow:**

1. Calculate expected earnings: `(Relays √ó Service CUPR √ó Multiplier √ó Supplier %)`
2. Compare against actual settlement amounts
3. Identify gaps from expired claims or failed proofs
4. Analyze revenue per staked token efficiency
5. Compare performance against network averages

**TODO**: Add specific query examples and calculation formulas

---

#### 2. Earnings Reconciliation & Forecasting

**Question**: "Why did I earn X instead of Y this month?"

**Required Data:**

- Historical settlement amounts by time period
- Relay mining difficulty changes
- Parameter changes during the period
- Application overservicing incidents
- Proof submission timing and success rates

**Events to Monitor:**

- `EventRelayMiningDifficultyUpdated` - Difficulty adjustments
- `EventApplicationOverserviced` - Overservicing incidents
- `EventTokenomicsParamsUpdated` - Parameter changes

**Analysis Workflow:**

1. Expected vs Actual calculation breakdown
2. Factor impact analysis (difficulty, inflation, overservicing)
3. Identify optimization opportunities
4. Project future earnings based on current trends

**TODO**: Add historical data aggregation methods and forecasting formulas

---

#### 3. Claim & Proof Management

**Question**: "What's my claim/proof status and what should I do?"

**Required Data:**

- Active claims by session and status
- Proof submission windows and deadlines
- Historical proof success rates
- Slashing risk exposure

**Parameters:**

- `proof_window_open_offset_blocks` - When proof window opens
- `proof_window_close_offset_blocks` - When proof window closes
- `proof_request_probability` - Probability of proof requirement

**Analysis Workflow:**

1. List active claims awaiting proof windows
2. Calculate upcoming proof deadlines
3. Assess risk of claim expiration
4. Prioritize proof submissions by value and deadline

**TODO**: Add claim status tracking queries and deadline calculations

---

### üì± Application/Consumer Workflows

#### 4. Service Cost Analysis & Budgeting

**Question**: "How much will my API usage cost and how can I optimize it?"

**Required Data:**

- Application address and usage patterns
- Historical tokens burned per session/service
- Overservicing incidents and additional costs
- Stake burn rate and refill frequency

**Events to Monitor:**

- `EventApplicationOverserviced` - Unexpected cost events
- `EventClaimSettled` - Actual costs incurred
- Application stake changes

**Parameters:**

- `compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier` - Base cost multiplier
- Service-specific `compute_units_per_relay` - Service pricing
- `mint_equals_burn_claim_distribution` - Cost allocation

**Analysis Workflow:**

1. Calculate historical cost per relay by service
2. Identify overservicing patterns and costs
3. Analyze stake burn rate and efficiency
4. Project future costs based on usage plans
5. Recommend optimal stake amounts

**TODO**: Add cost calculation formulas and optimization strategies

---

#### 5. Service Quality & Economic Efficiency

**Question**: "Am I getting good value for my spend?"

**Required Data:**

- Cost per successful relay vs market rates
- Service reliability and response times
- Supplier performance metrics
- Comparative cost analysis with other applications

**Analysis Workflow:**

1. Value analysis: cost vs performance correlation
2. Supplier performance comparison
3. Geographic and temporal cost variations
4. Service configuration optimization recommendations

**TODO**: Add quality metrics definition and benchmarking methods

- Distribution across stakeholder types
- Inflation rate trends
- Network activity metrics

**Events to Monitor:**
