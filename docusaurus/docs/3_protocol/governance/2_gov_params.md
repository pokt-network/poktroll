It acts as a denominator in the formula: compute_unit_cost_in_uPOKT = compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier / compute_unit_cost_granularity This enables high-precision pricing of compute units using integer math. For example: +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | compute_unit_cost_granularity | compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier unit | +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | 1   | uPOKT |     | 1_000 | nPOKT (nanoPOKT, 1e-3 uPOKT) |     | 1_000_000 | pPOKT (picoPOKT, 1e-6 uPOKT) | +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ ⚠️ Note: This value is a configurable global network parameter (not a constant). It must be a power of 10, allowing precise denomination shifts without affecting ongoing sessions. This prevents sessions from settling using parameters that were not in effect during their creation. |
