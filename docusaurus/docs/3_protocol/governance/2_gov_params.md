## Parameters

| Module | Field Name | Field Type | Comment |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| `application` | `max_delegated_gateways` | `uint64` | max_delegated_gateways defines the maximum number of gateways that a single application can delegate to. This is used to prevent performance issues in case the relay ring signature becomes too large. |
| `application` | `min_stake` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | min_stake is the minimum stake in upokt that an application must have to remain staked. |
| `gateway` | `min_stake` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | min_stake is the minimum amount of uPOKT that a gateway must stake. |
| `migration` | `allow_morse_account_import_overwrite` | `bool` | allow_morse_account_import_overwrite is a feature flag which is used to enable/disable the re-importing of Morse claimable accounts by the authority. Such a re-import will: - Ignore (i.e. leave) ALL claimed destination Shannon accounts/actors - Delete ALL existing onchain MorseClaimableAccounts - Import the new set of MorseClaimableAccounts from the provided MsgImportMorseClaimableAccounts This is useful for testing purposes, but should be disabled in production. |
| `migration` | `waive_morse_claim_gas_fees` | `bool` | waive_morse_claim_gas_fees is a feature flag used to enable/disable the waiving of gas fees for txs that: - Contain exactly one secp256k1 signer - Contain at least one Morse account/actor claim messages - Do not contain any other messages other than Morse account/actor claim messages |
| `proof` | `proof_missing_penalty` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | proof_missing_penalty is the number of tokens (uPOKT) which should be slashed from a supplier when a proof is required (either via proof_requirement_threshold or proof_missing_penalty) but is not provided. TODO_MAINNET_MIGRATION: Consider renaming this to `proof_missing_penalty_upokt`. |
| `proof` | `proof_request_probability` | `double` | proof_request_probability is the probability of a session requiring a proof if it's cost (i.e. compute unit consumption) is below the ProofRequirementThreshold. |
| `proof` | `proof_requirement_threshold` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | proof_requirement_threshold is the session cost (i.e. compute unit consumption) threshold which asserts that a session MUST have a corresponding proof when its cost is equal to or above the threshold. This is in contrast to the this requirement being determined probabilistically via ProofRequestProbability.  TODO_MAINNET_MIGRATION: Consider renaming this to `proof_requirement_threshold_upokt`. |
| `proof` | `proof_submission_fee` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | proof_submission_fee is the number of tokens (uPOKT) which should be paid by the supplier operator when submitting a proof. This is needed to account for the cost of storing proofs onchain and prevent spamming (i.e. sybil bloat attacks) the network with non-required proofs. TODO_MAINNET_MIGRATION: Consider renaming this to `proof_submission_fee_upokt`. |
| `service` | `add_service_fee` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | The amount of uPOKT required to add a new service. This will be deducted from the signer's account balance, and transferred to the pocket network foundation. |
| `service` | `target_num_relays` | `uint64` | target_num_relays is the target for the EMA of the number of relays per session. Per service, onchain relay mining difficulty will be adjusted to maintain this target. |
| `session` | `num_suppliers_per_session` | `uint64` | num_suppliers_per_session is the maximum number of suppliers per session (application:supplier pair for a given session number). |
| `shared` | `application_unbonding_period_sessions` | `uint64` | application_unbonding_period_sessions is the number of sessions that an application must wait after unstaking before their staked assets are moved to their account balance. Onchain business logic requires, and ensures, that the corresponding block count of the application unbonding period will exceed the end of its corresponding proof window close height. |
| `shared` | `claim_window_close_offset_blocks` | `uint64` | claim_window_close_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the claim window open height, at which the claim window closes. |
| `shared` | `claim_window_open_offset_blocks` | `uint64` | claim_window_open_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the session grace period height, at which the claim window opens. |
| `shared` | `compute_unit_cost_granularity` | `uint64` | compute_unit_cost_granularity is the fraction of the base unit (uPOKT) used to represent the smallest price of a single compute unit. compute_unit_cost_granularity defines the smallest fraction of uPOKT that can represent the cost of a single compute unit.  It acts as a denominator in the formula:  compute_unit_cost_in_uPOKT = compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier / compute_unit_cost_granularity  This enables high-precision pricing of compute units using integer math. For example:  +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | compute_unit_cost_granularity | compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier unit     | +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | 1                             | uPOKT                                       | | 1_000                         | nPOKT (nanoPOKT, 1e-3 uPOKT)                | | 1_000_000                     | pPOKT (picoPOKT, 1e-6 uPOKT)                | +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+  ⚠️ Note: This value is a configurable global network parameter (not a constant). It must be a power of 10, allowing precise denomination shifts without affecting ongoing sessions. This prevents sessions from settling using parameters that were not in effect during their creation. |
| `shared` | `compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier` | `uint64` | The amount of tokens that a compute unit should translate to when settling a session. It is denominated in fractional uPOKT (1/compute_unit_cost_granularity) DEV_NOTE: This used to be under x/tokenomics but has been moved here to avoid cyclic dependencies. |
| `shared` | `gateway_unbonding_period_sessions` | `uint64` | gateway_unbonding_period_sessions is the number of sessions that a gateway must wait after unstaking before their staked assets are moved to its account balance. |
| `shared` | `grace_period_end_offset_blocks` | `uint64` | grace_period_end_offset_blocks is the number of blocks, after the session end height, during which the supplier can still service payable relays. Suppliers will need to recreate a claim for the previous session (if already created) to get paid for the additional relays. |
| `shared` | `num_blocks_per_session` | `uint64` | num_blocks_per_session is the number of blocks between the session start & end heights. |
| `shared` | `proof_window_close_offset_blocks` | `uint64` | proof_window_close_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the proof window open height, at which the proof window closes. |
| `shared` | `proof_window_open_offset_blocks` | `uint64` | proof_window_open_offset_blocks is the number of blocks after the claim window close height, at which the proof window opens. |
| `shared` | `supplier_unbonding_period_sessions` | `uint64` | supplier_unbonding_period_sessions is the number of sessions that a supplier must wait after unstaking before their staked assets are moved to their account balance. Onchain business logic requires, and ensures, that the corresponding block count of the unbonding period will exceed the end of any active claim & proof lifecycles. |
| `supplier` | `min_stake` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | min_stake is the minimum amount of uPOKT that a supplier must stake to be included in network sessions and remain staked. |
| `supplier` | `staking_fee` | `cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin` | staking_fee is the fee charged by the protocol for staking a supplier. |
| `tokenomics` | `dao_reward_address` | `string` | dao_reward_address is the address to which mint_allocation_dao percentage of the minted tokens are at the end of claim settlement. |
| `tokenomics` | `global_inflation_per_claim` | `double` | global_inflation_per_claim is the percentage of a claim's claimable uPOKT amount which will be minted on settlement. |
| `tokenomics` | `mint_allocation_percentages` | `MintAllocationPercentages` | mint_allocation_percentages represents the distribution of newly minted tokens, at the end of claim settlement, as a result of the Global Mint TLM. |
