## Bridged Wallet Options

The EVM ([xERC-20](https://www.xerc20.com/)) implementation of the token and the Solana implementation of the token can be obtained by bridging your token via the official [Pocket Network Bridge](https://bridge.pokt.network/). Those bridged tokens can use any wallets that support Ethereum or Solana.

## Future Options

  - A new version of this wallet is in a private beta and this section will be updated when it is ready for public use.
- [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)
  - Ledger support is planned but isn't currently available.
