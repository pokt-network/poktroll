## Bash Install Script (Linux & MacOS)

Easiest, fastest way to get started that works on both Linux and MacOS.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokt-network/poktroll/main/tools/scripts/pocketd-install.sh | bash
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pocketd version
pocketd --help
```

---

## Homebrew (MacOS only)

For MacOS users who prefer [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew tap pokt-network/poktroll
brew install pocketd
```

### Troubleshooting Homebrew

If you have problems installing or upgrading `pocketd` via Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade pocketd
```

If it's still not working, try:

```bash
brew tap --repair
brew untap pokt-network/poktroll
brew uninstall pocketd
brew tap pokt-network/poktroll
brew install pocketd
```

The source code for the Homebrew formula can be found at [homebrew-pocketd](https://github.com/pokt-network/homebrew-pocketd).

## Alternative Methods

### Using release binaries

:::tip TL;DR manual download

- Download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest)
- Choose the correct `pocket_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz` for your system
- Untar and move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`

:::

```bash
# Download the correct binary for your OS and architecture
curl -LO "https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest/download/pocket_$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz"

# Extract to /usr/local/bin
sudo tar -zxf "pocket_$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz" -C /usr/local/bin

# Make it executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pocketd

# Check version
pocketd version
```

## Publishing a new CLI release

## 8. Update the `homebrew-tap` Formula

Once the upgrade is validated, update the tap so users can install the new CLI.

**Steps:**

cd homebrew-pocketd
make tap_update_version
git commit -am "Update pocket tap from v.X1.Y1.Z1 to v.X1.Y2.Z2"
git push
```

**Reinstall the CLI:**

```bash
brew reinstall pocketd
```

**Or install for the first time:**

```bash
brew tap pocket-network/homebrew-pocketd
brew install pocketd
```

See [pocketd CLI docs](../../2_explore/2_account_management/1_pocketd_cli.md) for more info.
