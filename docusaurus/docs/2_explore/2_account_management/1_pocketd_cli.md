## Bash Install Script (Linux & MacOS)

Easiest, fastest way to get started that works on both Linux and MacOS.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokt-network/poktroll/main/tools/scripts/pocketd-install.sh | bash
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pocketd version
pocketd --help
```

---

## Homebrew (MacOS only)

For MacOS users who prefer [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew tap pokt-network/poktroll
brew install pocketd
```

### Troubleshooting Homebrew

If you have problems installing or upgrading `pocketd` via Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade pocketd
```

If it's still not working, try:

```bash
brew tap --repair
brew untap pokt-network/poktroll
brew uninstall pocketd
brew tap pokt-network/poktroll
brew install pocketd
```

The source code for the Homebrew formula can be found at [homebrew-pocketd](https://github.com/pokt-network/homebrew-pocketd).

## Alternative Methods

### Using release binaries

:::tip TL;DR manual download

- Download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest)
- Choose the correct `pocket_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz` for your system
- Untar and move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`

:::

```bash
# Download the correct binary for your OS and architecture
curl -LO "https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest/download/pocket_$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz"

# Extract to /usr/local/bin
sudo tar -zxf "pocket_$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz" -C /usr/local/bin

# Make it executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pocketd

# Check version
pocketd version
```

Additional references and links:

- Pre-built binaries can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases)
- Latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest)

### From Source (danger zone)

:::warning
Do not continue unless you're a üöÄüë®‚Äçüíªüíé

For **ADVANCED** users only. Requires developer tools.
:::

#### Installation dependencies

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (v1.23+)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Ignite CLI](https://docs.ignite.com/welcome/install)

#### Build from source

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll.git pocket
cd pocket
```

And build the dependencies

```bash
make go_develop
```

Then, you have a few options:

1. Use the `make` target helper to use ignite indirecly:

   ```bash
   make ignite_pocketd_build
   ```

2. Use `Ignite` to build the binary directly to the `GOPATH`:

   ```bash
   ignite chain build --skip-proto --debug -v -o $(shell go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```

3. Use `Ignite` to build the binary directly to the current directory:

   ```bash
   ignite chain build --skip-proto --debug -v -o
   ```

When you're done, verify the installation:

```bash
pocketd version
pocketd --help
```

### Building Release Binaries From Source

The official binaries in our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases)
are built using [this GitHub workflow](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/actions/workflows/release-artifacts.yml).

You can build the release binaries locally for all CPU architectures like so:

```bash
make ignite_release
```

---

## Windows (why!?)

:::danger

- Native Windows installation is **not supported**.
- Use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- Follow the Linux install instructions above.

## Publishing a new `pocketd` release

:::warning Devs only

This section is intended for core protocol developers only.

:::

This section is intended **only for core protocol developers**.

It is also only intended for for dev releases of the `pocketd` CLI.

If you are publishing an official protocol upgrade accompanies by a CLI update, visit the [release procedure docs](../../4_develop//upgrades/2_release_procedure.md).

:::

### 1. Create a new `dev` git tag

```bash
# Clone the repository if you haven't already
git clone git@github.com:pokt-network/poktroll.git poktroll
cd poktroll

# Create a new dev git tag and follow the on-screen instructions
make release_tag_dev

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin $(git tag)
```

### 2. Draft a new GitHub release

Draft a new release at [pokt-network/poktroll/releases/new](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/new) using the tag (e.g. `v0.1.12-dev3`) created in the previous step.

Make sure to mark as a `pre-release` and use the auto-generated release notes for simplicity.

### 3. Wait for the release artifacts to be built (5 - 20 minutes)

The [release artifacts workflow](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/actions/workflows/release-artifacts.yml) will automatically build and publish the release artifacts to GitHub.

Wait for the release artifacts to be built and published to GitHub.

The artifacts will be attached an an `Asset` to your [release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases) once the workflow completes.

### 4. Verify via the `pocketd-install.sh` script

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokt-network/poktroll/main/tools/scripts/pocketd-install.sh | bash -s -- --tag v0.1.12-dev3 --upgrade
```
