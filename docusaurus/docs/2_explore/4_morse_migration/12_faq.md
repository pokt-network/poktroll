## What happens if I have a Morse node that is both a Validator and a Supplier?

During the Shannon migration, the node will **only** be claimed as a **Supplier**â€”which is equivalent to a **Servicer** in Morse.

The Validator role **DOES NOT** carry over.

Validators are handled separately. See [Claiming Morse Validators](./9_claiming_validator.md) for more details on validators.
