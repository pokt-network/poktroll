## Can I claim my Morse Validator as a Shannon Validator?

**No, you cannot claim a Morse Validator directly as a Shannon Validator.**

### 0. More Information

In Morse, Validators and Suppliers are coupled. Validators are "elected" to create blocks based on being in the top 1000 staked Validators. 

In Shannon, Validators and Suppliers are fundamentally different actors that require different stakes. 

Like in Morse, Validators in Shannon are also stake-weighted for election into the active pool. You can [read more about it in the Validator FAQ](../../1_operate/4_faq/3_validator_faq.md).
