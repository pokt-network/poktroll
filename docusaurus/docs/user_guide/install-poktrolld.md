:::note

Ready-to-use binaries and container images suitable for production environments are in the works. As an alternative option, building from the source code is a viable option.

:::

To install poktrolld, we recommend following the instructions provided in our [Developer Quickstart Guide](../developer_guide/quickstart.md). This guide outlines the steps necessary to build the poktrolld binary from source. Please note, you can bypass the sections related to Kubernetes setup and everything after `localnet_up` command for the purpose of this installation.
