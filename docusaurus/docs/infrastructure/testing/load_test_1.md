# Load Test #1 - Plan <!-- omit in toc -->

_This document outlines the first load test for the Shannon upgrade. IT **IS NOT** intended to be an exhaustive evaluation of the entire system's performance. **IT IS** intended to give visibility into the business logic of the platform, and create a baseline for future load tests._

## Goals

1. `De-risk` the network‚Äôs feasibility to have completely permissionless services & actors
   1. This is intended for `scalability` purposes and **does not** account for `Sybil` attacks
2. `Stress test` the SMT (Sparse Merkle Trie) and how it is being used
3. `Build intuition` into the cost of operating the network for all of the stakeholders involved, both on & off chain
4. `Gain visibility` into basic metrics (disk, RAM, CPU, ingress/egress traffic, etc.‚Ä¶) for our network actors
5. `Uncover` potential bugs, bottlenecks or concurrency issues in the on-chain & off-chain code
6. `Document and design` a process that‚Äôll act as the foundation for future load-testing efforts

## Non-Goals

1. `Exhaustive benchmarking` of all traditional performance metrics across our tools & packages (`key-value stores`, `http libs`, etc‚Ä¶)
2. `Sybil attacks` tokenomic considerations
3. Perform any of the following tests: `smoke tests`, `spike tests`, `fuzzy testing`, `chaos testing`, `soak testing` etc‚Ä¶
4. `Evaluating` the performance or results of `proxy services` / `data nodes`
5. `Selecting new tools` or libraries as a direct outcome of these results.
6. `Mimicking the scale` of Morse (v0) today
7. Accounting for `Failure cases`, since the primary focus is just evaluating happy path scale
8. Anything to do with `Quality of Service` as it is concerned from today‚Äôs Gateway POV

## Load Profiles

### Variable Parameters

| Metric                  | Starting Value | Terminal Value | Increment (fuzz + approximate)                |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| RelaysPerSecond         | 1 rps          | 10,000 rps     | +100 rps every 10 blocks                      |
| GatewayCount            | 1              | 10             | +1 gateway every 100 blocks                   |
| ApplicationCount        | 5              | 1,000          | +10 apps every 10 blocks                      |
| SupplierCount           | 5              | 1,00           | +1 every 100 blocks                           |
| ProxyService / DataNode | 0 / ‚àû          | 0 / ‚àû          | Mocked to avoid being a performance bottlneck |

### Constant Parameter

- `BlockTime` - A constant block time between 10s and 60s will be selected for the benchmarks in this test
- `RequestType` - We will use a ‚Äúdummy‚Äù backing data node / proxy service that leverages `nginx` to return a `200` or 500 randomly
- `RequestDistribution` - The `RelaysPerSecond` will be evenely distributed
- `VirtualUsers` - For simplicity, we will assume a `1:1` mapping of virtual users (i.e. curl clients) to `Applications`

### Out-of-scope Parameters

- `Governance Parameters` have not been implemented yet and are therefore out-of-scope

## Measurements

### What to measure?

#### 1. Chain State Size

`What`:

- A `pie chart` or `stacked bar chart` of how the data in the Blocks is distributed
- A `line chart` showing state growth over size

`Why`

- Get an estimate of the cost of data publishing (i.e. TIA tokens)
- Get an estimate of data distribution (where to focus short-term optimizaiton efforts)

`Example:`

```mermaid
pie showData
    title State Distribution in one block
    "Proofs" : 30
    "Claims" : 20
    "Applications" : 10
    "Suppliers" : 10
    "Gateways" : 10
    "Signatures" : 10
    "Misc" : 10
```

#### 2. Sequencer (Validator, etc‚Ä¶)

`What`: Multiple `line charts` to capture `Disk` (size & iops), `RAM`, `CPU` , `Network` usage (ingress/egress)

`Why`:

- `Proof Validation` - `RAM` & `CPU` could be a potential bottleneck
- `Block generation` - `RAM` & `CPU` could be a bottleneck in preparing new blocks
- `Block Publishing` - `Tx` aggregation (ingress) and `Block` publishing (egress) could be more expensive than expected w.r.t network usage
- `Rollup State` - `Disk` could be a limiting factor depending on how quickly state grows

|                  | RAM  | CPU  | Network | Disk |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ---- |
| Proof Validation | ¬† ‚ùì | ¬† ‚ùì |         |      |
| Block Generation | ¬† ‚ùì | ¬† ‚ùì |         |      |
| Block Publishing |      |      | ¬† ‚ùì    |      |
| Rollup State     |      |      |         | ¬† ‚ùì |

#### 3. AppGate Server (Application, Gateway, etc‚Ä¶)

`What`: Multiple `line charts` to capture `Disk` (size & iops), `RAM`, `CPU` , `Network` usage (ingress/egress)

`Why`:

- `Relay Proxies` Ingress/egress of relays could add up to large networking costs
- `Caches & State` - All the caching & state can have impact across the board
- `Request Processing` - Signature generation, request marshaling / unmarshaling, etc‚Ä¶
- `Response handling` - Slow supplier responses could increase pending relays at the AppGate level (i.e. RAM)

|                    | RAM | CPU | Network | Disk |
| ------------------ | --- | --- | ------- | ---- |
| Relay Proxies      |     |     | ¬† ‚ùì    |      |
| Caches & State     | ‚ùì  | ‚ùì  |         |      |
| Request Processing | ‚ùì  | ‚ùì  |         |      |
| ???                |     |     |         | ¬† ‚ùì |

#### 4. RelayMiner (Supplier, SMT, etc..)

`What`: Multiple `line charts` to capture `Disk` (size & iops), `RAM`, `CPU` , `Network` usage (ingress/egress)

`Why`:

- `SMT` - The `SMT` is one of the most important parts of the end-to-end flow which has impact on `RAM`, `CPU` & `disk`
- `Caches & State` - All the caching & state can have impact across the board
- `Request Processing` - Signature generation, request marshaling / unmarshaling, etc‚Ä¶
- `Request generation` - Generating the actual response to the request via the dummy service

|                    | RAM  | CPU  | Network | Disk |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- | ------- | ---- |
| SMT                | ¬† ‚ùì | ¬† ‚ùì |         | ‚ùì   |
| Caches & State     | ¬† ‚ùì |      |         |      |
| Request Processing | ¬† ‚ùì |      |         |      |
| Request Generation | ¬† ‚ùì | ¬† ‚ùì | ¬† ‚ùì    |      |

### Out-of-scope

The exact details of the implementation are out-of-scope and will be developed adhoc along the way. The following is a non-exhaustive list of items we will figure out along the way:

1. Data Collection
2. ConcreteAnalysis Methodology
3. Templates for format reporting
