## Swagger UI

The Swagger UI for the Shannon Beta TestNet OpenAPI Spec may be viewed at [shannon-testnet-grove-api.beta.poktroll.com](https://shannon-testnet-grove-api.beta.poktroll.com).

## Re-generating the OpenAPI Spec

You can re-generate the OpenAPI spec by running the following command:

```bash

## `Cosmos` REST API vs `CometBFT` RPC

### External Resources

:::warning

We are not going to dive into a discussion of REST vs RPC HTTP APIs here, but will provide minimal context.

:::

You can read about the general differences between REST and RPC APIs [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/understanding-rest-and-rpc-for-http-apis/).

The `CometBFT` RPC Specification can be found [here](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.34/rpc/).

The `Cosmos SDK` REST API Specification can be found [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/api).

### `Cosmos` - Example command to check accounts

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://shannon-testnet-grove-api.beta.poktroll.com/cosmos/auth/v1beta1/accounts' -H 'accept: application/json' | jq
```

### `Cosmos` - Example command to check node status

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://shannon-testnet-grove-api.beta.poktroll.com/cosmos/base/node/v1beta1/status' -H 'accept: application/json' | jq
```

### `CometBFT` - Example command to check node status

```bash
curl -X 'GET' 'https://shannon-testnet-grove-rpc.beta.poktroll.com/status' -H 'accept: application/json' | jq
```

## Cosmos SDK & CometBFT API Comparison

- **CometBFT RPC (`26657`)** ‚Üí **Independent of Cosmos SDK APIs**. Used for blockchain consensus, P2P networking, and transaction broadcasting.
- **Cosmos SDK gRPC (`9090`)** ‚Üí **The core application API**. Provides structured, high-performance blockchain state queries.
- **Cosmos SDK REST API (`1317`)** ‚Üí **A wrapper around Cosmos SDK gRPC** for frontend-friendly JSON-based queries.

:::note

üí° **If gRPC (`9090`) is disabled, the REST API (`1317`) will not work.**
üí° **If CometBFT RPC (`26657`) is down, the blockchain itself may be offline, but Cosmos SDK APIs can still work if the app is running.**

### What is it?

| **Layer**                                                                   | **What is it?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CometBFT RPC** _(Independent of the Cosmos SDK gRPC and REST API)_        | A **low-level RPC interface** that interacts with the **Tendermint consensus engine**. It is **completely independent** of the Cosmos SDK gRPC and REST API. Used for network, consensus, and blockchain-related queries (**not** application state). Also used for **sending transactions** and querying blockchain state at a protocol level.                |
| **Cosmos SDK gRPC** _(The core application-level API)_                      | A **high-performance binary API** for querying **Cosmos SDK modules**. Provides **structured access** to chain state using **protobuf messages**. Used by full nodes, wallets, and services for **efficient state access**. **üöÄ All Cosmos SDK REST API requests ultimately rely on this gRPC API.**                                                          |
| **Cosmos SDK REST API (gRPC-Gateway)** _(A wrapper around Cosmos SDK gRPC)_ | A **RESTful wrapper** around **Cosmos SDK gRPC** that translates gRPC queries into **HTTP REST endpoints**. Enables **browser-friendly** and **frontend-compatible** access to Cosmos SDK modules. Uses **JSON over HTTP** instead of binary gRPC messages. **üöÄ This API depends entirely on the Cosmos SDK gRPC API and does not work if gRPC is disabled.** |

### Example Ports & Commands

## Claude Generated Queries

:::warning üßë‚Äçüî¨Experimental üßë‚Äçüî¨

This is just an experimental attempt to help investigate onchain data

:::

You can setup a [Claude Project](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects) to ask simple questions about querying onchain data:

For example, you can ask it to generate a query for a specific endpoint:

![claude-query-response](../../../static/img/claude-query-response.png)

To get queries that work out of the box:

![claude-query-result](../../../static/img/claude-query-result.png)

### Claude Project Instructions

1. Go to [Claude Projects](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects)
2. Create a new project
3. Set the project instructions to the prompt below.
4. Set the project knowledge base to a portion of the [Full OpenAPI Spec](https://shannon-testnet-grove-api.beta.poktroll.com/static/openapi.yml) (see below).
5. Ask a question about the OpenAPI spec.

<details>
<summary>Claude Project Instructions (i.e. Prompt)</summary>

````text
**Below the OpenAPI.yml line below, I have provided the OpenAPI spec for Pocket Network's Cosmos SDK app chain.**

You are a professional Cosmos SDK engineer with expertise in formatting CometBFT and Cosmos queries for the Pocket Network ecosystem.

**Your role:** Transform general blockchain query requests into properly formatted `pocketd` commands with appropriate filtering and JSON processing.

**Available endpoints:**
* **Mainnet:** https://shannon-grove-rpc.mainnet.poktroll.com
* **Testnet:** https://shannon-testnet-grove-rpc.beta.poktroll.com

**Query format guidelines:**
- Always include `--node` parameter with appropriate endpoint
- Use `--query` for transaction filtering with proper syntax
- Include pagination (`--limit`, `--page`) when relevant
- Output as JSON (`-o json`)
- Pipe to `jq` for data extraction and formatting when needed

**Example interaction:**
Request: "Show me all create claim messages after height 20000"
Response:
```bash
pocketd query txs \
    --node=https://shannon-testnet-grove-rpc.beta.poktroll.com \
    --query="tx.height>20000 AND message.action='/pocket.proof.MsgCreateClaim'" \
    --limit "10" --page 1 -o json |
    jq '[.txs[].tx.body.messages[]
    | select(."@type" == "/pocket.proof.MsgCreateClaim" and .supplier_operator_address != null)
    | .supplier_operator_address]
    | unique'

          compute_unit_cost_granularity defines the smallest fraction of uPOKT that can represent
          the cost of a single compute unit.

          It acts as a denominator in the formula:

            compute_unit_cost_in_uPOKT = compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier / compute_unit_cost_granularity

          This enables high-precision pricing of compute units using integer math.
          For example:

          +-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
          | compute_unit_cost_granularity | compute_units_to_tokens_multiplier unit     |
