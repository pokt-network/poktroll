## 1. Protocol Upgrade Preparation

Only follow these instructions after you have completed a successful upgrade on Alpha & Beta TestNet
by following the instructions in [Protocol Upgrade Preparation](2_upgrade_preparation.md).

## 2. Keep Clear Communication

Keep the following stakeholders in the loop along the way

1. Pocket Network Discord Server; [Beta TestNet](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/1384591252758200330) and [MainNet](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/1234943674903953529)
2. Grove [Pocketd](https://discord.com/channels/824324475256438814/1138895490331705354) Discord
3. Exchanges that support Pocket Network and communicate [via telegram](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/blob/main/.github/workflows/telegram-send-message.yml)

## 2. Choose a height

1. Visit the [MainNet Grafana Dashboard](https://grafana.poktroll.com/goto/5XmC4RjNR?orgId=1) to get the current height of the blockchain
2. Review the latest block times of the network by checking network stats, [grove's infra](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/infrastructure/blob/dfbc02c57bbc5e61ae860393ec35d45b6a6fc3d5/environments/protocol/vultr-sgp/kubernetes-manifests/mainnet/config-files.yaml#L505) or [config.toml](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-network-genesis/blob/master/shannon/mainnet/config.toml); _usually 30s per block_.
3. Determine a future height that gives the ecosystem a few days to prepare.
4. For your particular upgrade (e.g. `v0.1.21`), update the `height` in `tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.21_main.json`:

## 3. Submit the Upgrade on MainNet

```bash
./tools/scripts/upgrades/submit_upgrade.sh main v0.1.21
```

## 4. Broadcast Telegram Announcement

1. Install the [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
2. Prepare all the exchanges that support Pocket Network and communicate [via telegram](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/blob/main/.github/workflows/telegram-send-message.yml)
3. Run the following command:

```bash
make telegram_broadcast MSG="üì£ Update from Pocket Network: `v0.1.21` is scheduled for release in approximately 1-3 days üì£"
```

## 5. Ensure Snapshots Available

## 6. Update the GitHub Release Notes

1. Generate a table of the upgrade heights and tx hashes like so:

   ```bash
   ./tools/scripts/upgrades/prepare_upgrade_release_notes.sh v0.1.21
   ```

2. Insert the table above the auto-generated [release notes](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases).
3. Mark it as `latest release`.

## 7. Update the Documentation Upgrade List

Update the [Upgrade List Documentation](6_upgrade_list.md) with the new upgrade.

Use the [release notes](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest) to populate the upgrade list.

## 9. Day of Upgrade

Firstly, it goes without saying, keep comms with the entire ecosystem.

### 9.1 Prepare Another Snapshot Before the Upgrade

### 9.2 Monitor the Upgrade

### 8.3 Telegram Release Bot

If you have the [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed, you can simply run:

```bash
make telegram_release_notify
```

You can also test the release notification by running:

```bash
make telegram_test_release
```

:::

After setting it as `latest release`, use the [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/blob/main/.github/workflows/telegram-notify-release.yml) to automatically notify the Telegram groups.

Go to [this link](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/actions/workflows/telegram-notify-release.yml) and click `Run workflow`.

This will send the details in the GitHub release to all exchanges.

:::warning TODO: Releases that are too long

You might get an error that the [message is too long](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/actions/runs/15860176445/job/44715185450).

If this happens, then:

1. Remove unnecessary content from the release notes
2. Run the workflow again
3. Revert the release with all the details

## 8. Update the `pocketd` binary

Once the upgrade is validated, update the tap so users can install the new CLI.

**Run the following steps:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pokt-network/homebrew-pocketd.git
cd homebrew-pocketd
make tap_update_version
git commit -am "Update pocket tap from v.<Previous Version> to v.<New Version>"
git push
```

_Note: Make sure to update `v0.1.20` and `v0.1.21` in the commit message above._

**Reinstall the CLI:**

```bash
brew reinstall pocketd
```

OR

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokt-network/poktroll/main/tools/scripts/pocketd-install.sh | bash -s -- --upgrade
```

**Alternatively, install it for the first time:**

```bash
brew tap pocket-network/homebrew-pocketd
brew install pocketd
