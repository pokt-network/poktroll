Rought notes while going through the upgrade

- Not enough copy-pasta
- Hide unnecessary context for pure operators (non-developers)
- Export the proper vars
- Use all the new flags
- How do you query abci_info?
- Avoid hardcoded examples
- Use the --network flag
- pocketd query upgrade plan --network=NETWORK

Troubleshooting the update:

- Look at the validator pods & logs
- See if they're continuting fine or in a crashloop backoff

Replacing the binary:

- 1. Replace cmd/args with infinite loop so we can shell
- 2. Create a copy-pasta script o edit the config
- 3. Ensure we have a "copy inifinte loop bash"
- 4. Replace all of the args
- 5. Restart the validator after applying the config
- 6. Kill pod
- 7. Shell into the container
- ls -la /home/pocket/.pocket/cosmosirvisor
- Ensure there's an upgrade handler

Deleting releases:

- Delete release
- Delete tag (local and remote)
- Override
- Possible because we have no checksums
- Explain the process
