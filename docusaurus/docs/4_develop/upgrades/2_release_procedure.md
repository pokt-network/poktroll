:::important
This is the step-by-step (almost) üñ®üçù checklist for core protocol developers to release protocol upgrades.

**‚ùó DO NOT PROCEED if you are not comfortable with Git, GitHub releases, scripting, etc‚ùó**
:::

## If this is your first time managing an upgrade, learn the following <!-- omit in toc -->

- Ensure you know [When is a Protocol Upgrade Needed?](./1_protocol_upgrades.md#when-is-a-protocol-upgrade-needed)
- Ensure you have push access to [pokt-network/poktroll](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll)
- Ensure you have the required CLI tools (`git`, `make`, `jq`, `sed`, `curl`, `go`, `brew`, `pocketd`, etc.)
- Understand `state-breaking` vs `consensus-breaking` changes from the [overview](./1_protocol_upgrades.md)
- Be aware of the list of [previous upgrades](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/tree/main/app/upgrades) for reference
- If you implemented the upgrade, familiarize yourself with [how to test changes locally](3_testing_upgrades_locally.md)

## 1. Prepare a New Upgrade Handler

1. Identify the version of the last [release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases) (e.g. `v0.1.20`)
2. Prepare a new upgrade handler by copying `vNEXT.go` to the next release (e.g. `v0.1.21`) like so:

   ```bash
   cp app/upgrades/vNEXT.go app/upgrades/v0.1.21.go
   ```

3. Open `v0.1.21.go` and replace all instances of `vNEXT` with `v0.1.21`.
4. Open `app/upgrades.go` and add the new upgrade to `allUpgrades`, commenting out the old upgrade.
5. Prepare a new `vNEXT.go` by copying `vNEXT_Template.go` to `vNEXT.go` like so:

   ```bash
   cp app/upgrades/vNEXT_Template.go app/upgrades/vNEXT.go
   ```

6. Open `vNEXT.go` and remove all instances of `Template`.
7. Create a PR with these changes ([example](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/pull/1489)) and merge it.

## 2. Create a GitHub Release

1. **Tag the release** using one of the following and follow on-screen prompts:

   ```bash
   make release_tag_bug_fix
   # or
   make release_tag_minor_release
   ```

2. **Publish the release** by:

   - [Drafting a new release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/new)
   - Use the tag above to auto-generate the release notes

3. **Set as a pre-release** (change to `latest release` after upgrade completes).

:::note üòé Keep Calm and Wait for CI üòÖ

Wait for the [`Release Artifacts`](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/actions/workflows/release-artifacts.yml) CI job to build artifacts for your release.

It'll take ~20 minutes and will be auto-attached to the release once complete.

:::

## 3. Prepare the Upgrade Transactions

**Generate the new upgrade transaction JSON files like so**:

```bash
./tools/scripts/upgrades/prepare_upgrade_tx.sh v<YOUR_VERSION>.<YOUR_RELEASE>.<YOUR_PATCH>
```

Will create:

```bash
tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_vX.Y.Z_alpha.json
tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_vX.Y.Z_beta.json
tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_vX.Y.Z_local.json
tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_vX.Y.Z_main.json
```

For example:

```bash
./tools/scripts/upgrades/prepare_upgrade_tx.sh v0.1.20
```

Note that the `height` is not populated in the `*.json` files.

You will need to update the `height` before submitting each one. More on this later...

<details>
<summary>Example JSON snippet:</summary>

```json
{
  "body": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "@type": "/cosmos.upgrade.v1beta1.MsgSoftwareUpgrade",
        "authority": "pokt10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j8yv32t",
        "plan": {
          "name": "v0.0.4",
          "height": "30",
          "info": "{\"binaries\":{...}}"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>**Optional**: Validate the Upgrade Binary URLs (Live Network Only)</summary>

Install `go-getter` if you don't have it:

```bash
go install github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/cmd/go-getter@latest
```

And check all binary URLs:

```bash
RELEASE_VERSION=<VERSION> # E.g. "v0.1.11"
for file in ./tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_${RELEASE_VERSION}*; do
  echo "Processing $file"
  jq -r '.body.messages[0].plan.info | fromjson | .binaries[]' "$file" | while IFS= read -r url; do
    go-getter "$url" .
  done
done
```

Expected output should look like the following:

```bash
2025/04/16 12:11:36 success!
2025/04/16 12:11:40 success!
2025/04/16 12:11:44 success!
2025/04/16 12:11:48 success!
```

</details>

## 4. Test the New Release Locally

- Follow [Testing Protocol Upgrades](3_testing_upgrades_locally.md) **before** submitting any transactions.
- If you find an issue, you'll need to repeat the steps as needed (update plan, release, transactions, etc.).

---

## 5. Submit the Upgrade on Alpha TestNet

This step is parameterized so you can use it for any network (Alpha, Beta, or MainNet). Substitute the variables below as needed.

**Variables:**

- `NETWORK`: one of (`local`, `alpha`, `beta`, `main`)
- `RPC_ENDPOINT`: The RPC endpoint for the network (e.g., `https://shannon-testnet-grove-rpc.alpha.poktroll.com`)
- `UPGRADE_TX_JSON`: Path to the upgrade transaction JSON (e.g., `tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_alpha.json`)
- `FROM_ACCOUNT`: The account submitting the transaction (e.g., `pnf_alpha`)
- `TX_HASH`: The hash of the submitted transaction (for monitoring)

**Step-by-Step instructions:**

1. Get the RPC endpoint for `NETWORK`. Example for Alpha [here](https://dev.poktroll.com/tools/tools/shannon_alpha).
2. Update the `height` in your upgrade transaction JSON ():

   :::tip Export `UPGRADE_TX_JSON`, `RPC_ENDPOINT`, `NETWORK`, and `FROM_ACCOUNT`

   ```bash
   export RPC_ENDPOINT=https://shannon-testnet-grove-rpc.alpha.poktroll.com
   export UPGRADE_TX_JSON="tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_alpha.json"
   export NETWORK=alpha
   export FROM_ACCOUNT=pnf_alpha
   ```

   :::

   ```bash
   # Get the current height
   CURRENT_HEIGHT=$(pocketd q block --network=${NETWORK} -o json | tail -n +2 | jq -r '.header.height') # Add 5 blocks (arbitrary, adjust as needed)
   UPGRADE_HEIGHT=$((CURRENT_HEIGHT + 5))
   # Update the JSON
   sed -i.bak "s/\"height\": \"[^\"]*\"/\"height\": \"$UPGRADE_HEIGHT\"/" ${UPGRADE_TX_JSON}
   # Cat the output file
   cat ${UPGRADE_TX_JSON}
   ```

3. Submit the transaction:

   ```bash
   pocketd \
     --keyring-backend="test" --home="~/.pocket" \
     --fees=300upokt --network=${NETWORK} \
     tx authz exec ${UPGRADE_TX_JSON} --from=${FROM_ACCOUNT}
   ```

   :::tip Grove Employee Helpers üåø

   If you're a Grove Employee, you can use the helpers [here](https://www.notion.so/buildwithgrove/Playbook-Streamlining-rc-helpers-for-Shannon-Alpha-Beta-Main-Network-Environments-152a36edfff680019314d468fad88864?pvs=4) to use this wrapper:

   ```bash
   pkd_<NETWORK>_tx authz exec ${UPGRADE_TX_JSON} --from=${FROM_ACCOUNT}
   ```

4. Verify the upgrade is planned onchain:

   ```bash
   pocketd query upgrade plan --network=${NETWORK}
   ```

5. Watch the transaction (using the TX_HASH from step 3):

   ```bash
   watch -n 5 "pocketd query tx --type=hash ${TX_HASH} --network=${NETWORK}"
   ```

6. Verify node version aligns with what's in `<UPGRADE_TX_JSON>`:

   ```bash
   curl -s ${RPC_ENDPOINT}/abci_info | jq '.result.response.version'
   ```

7. Once the upgrade is complete, make sure to:
   - Record the upgrade `height` and `tx_hash` in the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases)
   - Commit the `{UPGRADE_TX_JSON}` file with the final height to `main`

:::tip Grove Employees üåø

- Use logging/observability tools to monitor full nodes & validators.
- Only proceed to Beta/MainNet after Alpha is successful.
- [Connect to our cluster](https://www.notion.so/buildwithgrove/Playbook-Connecting-to-Vultr-Protocol-k8s-cluster-protocol-nj-162a36edfff680608c30ff9eebd3e605?pvs=4) to inspect logs and pod status

:::

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT PROCEED until the changes from step (2) are merged assuming the upgrade succeeded ‚ö†Ô∏è**

## 9. Submit the Upgrade on Beta & MainNet

Repeat [Step 7: Submit the Upgrade Onchain](#7-submit-the-upgrade-on-alpha-testnet) with the appropriate parameters for Beta and MainNet:

- Use the correct `<RPC_ENDPOINT>` for Beta or MainNet
- Use the correct `<NETWORK>`, (`beta` for Beta or `main` for MainNet)
- Use the correct `<UPGRADE_TX_JSON>` (e.g., `upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_beta.json` or `upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_main.json`)
- Use the correct sender account for each network

This ensures a single, copy-pasta-friendly process for all networks.

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT PROCEED until the changes from step (2) are merged assuming the upgrade succeeded ‚ö†Ô∏è**

commands on how `v0.1.3` was submitted on Alpha & Beta.

:::

## 7. Update the release notes

```bash
tools/scripts/upgrades/prepare_upgrade_release_notes.sh v0.1.19
```

## 8. Update the `homebrew-tap` Formula

Once the upgrade is validated, update the tap so users can install the new CLI.

**Steps:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pokt-network/homebrew-pocketd.git
cd homebrew-pocketd
make tap_update_version
git commit -am "Update pocket tap from v.X1.Y1.Z1 to v.X1.Y2.Z2"
git push
```

**Reinstall the CLI:**

```bash
brew reinstall pocketd
```

**Or install for the first time:**

```bash
brew tap pocket-network/homebrew-pocketd
brew install pocketd
```

See [pocketd CLI docs](../../2_explore/2_account_management/1_pocketd_cli.md) for more info.
