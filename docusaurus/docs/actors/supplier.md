## Overview

A `Supplier` is responsible for staking POKT in order to earn POKT in exchange for
providing services as a function of volume and time.

## Schema

The on-chain representation of a `Supplier` can be found at [supplier.proto](./../../../proto/pocket/supplier/supplier.proto).

## Configuration

Configurations to stake an `Supplier` can be found at [supplier_staking_config.md](../configs/supplier_staking_config.md).

## CLI

All of the read (i.e. query) based operations for the `Supplier` actor can be
viewed by running:

```bash
poktrolld query supplier
```

All of the write (i.e. tx) based operations for the `Suplier` actor can be
viewed by running:

```bash
poktrolld tx supplier
```
