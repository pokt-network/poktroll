## What is a Full Node

In blockchain networks, a full node retains continuous synchs and updates the latest copy of the
ledger. It may either be pruned full node (the latest data only) or an archival full node (including
complete and historical data).

You can visit the [Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/user/run-node/run-node)
for more information on Full Nodes.

## What is Cosmovisor

As an alternative to our [Full Node - Docker](./full_node_docker.md) guide, we also provide documentation on how to deploy
a Full Node using Cosmovisor.

[Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor) is a tool that automates the version management
for our blockchain. It allows operators to automatically upgrade their full nodes and validators without downtime and
reduce maintenance overhead.
