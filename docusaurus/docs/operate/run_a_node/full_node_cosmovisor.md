## What is a Full Node

In blockchain networks, a Full Node retains a complete copy of the ledger.

You can visit the [Cosmos SDK documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/user/run-node/run-node)
for more information on Full Nodes.

## What is Cosmovisor

[Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor) is a tool that automates the version management
for our blockchain. It allows operators to automatically upgrade their full nodes and validators without downtime and
reduce maintenance overhead.
