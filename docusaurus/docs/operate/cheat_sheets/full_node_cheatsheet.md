## Install and Run a Full Node using Cosmovisor

:::info
This section's script will handle the installation of dependencies, user creation,
environment variable setup, and configuration of Cosmovisor and `poktrolld`.
:::

Follow the instructions below to **quickly** install and set up a Full Node:

1. **Download the Installation Script**:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pokt-network/poktroll/main/tools/installer/full-node.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Script with Sudo Privileges**:

   ```bash
   sudo bash full-node.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**:

   1. **Choose the Network**: Select `testnet-alpha`, `testnet-beta`, or `mainnet`.
   2. **Set Username**: Input the desired username to run `poktrolld` (default: `poktroll`).
   3. **Set Node Moniker**: Input the node moniker (default: your `hostname`).
   4. **Confirm Seeds and Genesis File**: The script fetches seeds and the genesis file automatically.
   5. **External IP Address**: The script detects your external IP address. Confirm or input manually if incorrect.

### Verify successful installation using `curl`

We are going to use `curl` to query the latest block to verify the installation was successful.

Running the following command will return the latest synched block height:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:26657/block | jq '.result.block.header.height'
```

Or the following command to get the entire block:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:26657/block | jq
```

Which should return a response similar to the following format:

```json

### How are automatic upgrades handled out of the box?

Your node is configured to handle chain upgrades automatically through Cosmovisor. No manual intervention is required for standard upgrades.

When a chain upgrade is proposed and approved:

1. Cosmovisor will download the new binary
2. The node will stop at the designated upgrade height
3. Cosmovisor will switch to the new binary
4. The node will restart automatically

## Do you care to know what just happened?

:::info Optional reading for the curious

This section is optional and for informational purposes only.

:::

If you're interested in understanding what just got installed, keep reading...

1. **System User**: A dedicated user (default: `poktroll`) is created to run the node securely.

2. **Cosmovisor**: A binary manager that handles chain upgrades automatically:

   - **Location**: `/home/poktroll/bin/cosmovisor`
   - **Purpose**: Manages different versions of `poktrolld` and handles chain upgrades
   - **Configuration**: Set up to automatically download and switch to new binaries during upgrades

3. **Poktrolld**: The core node software:

   - **Location**: `/home/poktroll/.poktroll/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/poktrolld`
   - **Configuration**: `/home/poktroll/.poktroll/config/`
   - **Data**: `/home/poktroll/.poktroll/data/`

4. **Systemd Service**: A service that manages the node:
   - **Name**: `cosmovisor.service`
   - **Status**: Enabled and started automatically
   - **Configured** for automatic restarts and upgrades
