## Infrastructure provisioning

- **Grove & Kubernetes**: The Kubernetes cluster is provisioned using Grove's internal tooling.
- **Main Cluster**: We set up ArgoCD on the cluster and configure it to sync the [main/root application on the cluster](https://github.com/pokt-network/protocol-infra/blob/main/clusters/protocol-us-central1-app.yaml).
- **App of Apps**: ArgoCD provisions all the necessary resources and other ArgoCD Applications included in that Application, following the [ArgoCD App of Apps pattern](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/).
- As a part of that ArgoCD Application we have resources such as StatefulSets and ConfigMaps that describe configuration and infrastructure to run validators and seed nodes. Examples:
  - [testnet-validated.yaml](https://github.com/pokt-network/protocol-infra/blob/main/clusters/protocol-us-central1/testnet-validated.yaml)
  - [testnet-validated-seed.yaml](https://github.com/pokt-network/protocol-infra/blob/main/clusters/protocol-us-central1/testnet-validated-seed.yaml)
  <!-- TODO(@okdas): improve the setup because this requires an abstraction. -->

## Version upgrade
