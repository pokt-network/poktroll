## What is PATH Gateway?

See the [PATH Gateway](https://path.grove.city) documentation for more
information on what a `PATH Gateway` is. This page aims to provide links and
details on how to deploy and operate it.

## PATH Gateway Operation Requirements

A PATH Gateway requires the following:

1. A staked onchain [Application](../../protocol/actors/application.md) to pay for services.
2. An optional onchain [Gateway](../../protocol/actors/gateway.md) to optionally proxy services.
3. A connection to a [Full Node](./full_node_docker.md) to interact with the blockchain.

:::tip
It is crucial to deploy a [Full Node](full_node_docker.md) prior to setting up a RelayMiner.
This ensures the necessary infrastructure for blockchain communication is in place.

## Hardware requirements

Please see the [Hardware Requirements](../configs/hardware_requirements.md#path-gateway) page.

## Docker Compose Example

Please refer to the `Deploying a PATH Gateway` section in [Docker compose walkthrough](../../operate/walkthroughs/docker_compose_walkthrough.md) for detailed instructions
on how to deploy a `PATH Gateway` using `docker-compose`.

## Kubernetes Example

_TODO_DOCUMENT: Provide an example using [strangelove-ventures/cosmos-operator](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/cosmos-operator)._
