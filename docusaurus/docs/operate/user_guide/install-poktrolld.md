TODO(@okdas): Ready-to-use binaries and container images suitable for PROD
environments are in progress. As an alternative option, building from src is possible.

:::

To install `poktrolld`, we recommend following the instructions provided in our [Developer Quickstart Guide](../../develop/developer_guide/quickstart.md). This guide outlines the steps necessary to build the poktrolld binary from source.

Please note, you can bypass the sections related to Kubernetes setup and everything
after `localnet_up` command for the purpose of this installation.
