## üì†üçù Local Upgrade Testing ‚Äì Step-by-Step

**This is a copy/paste-ready checklist for validating protocol upgrades locally.**

- Every step is numbered and must be completed in order.
- All commands are ready to copy/paste.
- If you get stuck, ask for help.

## 0. Notes & Prerequisites

- Example upgrade: `v0.1.1` ‚Üí `v0.1.2` (macOS, arm64)
- Local environments **do not** support `cosmovisor`/automatic upgrades. This is fine for testing.
- Update this doc for each new upgrade (see TODOs).

---

## 1. Start node with old version

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pokt-network/poktroll.git poktroll_old
cd poktroll_old
gco v0.1.1
make go_develop ignite_release ignite_release_extract_binaries
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 comet unsafe-reset-all && make localnet_regenesis
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start
```

---

## 2. Start node with new version

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pokt-network/poktroll.git poktroll_new
cd poktroll_new
gco v0.1.2
make go_develop ignite_release ignite_release_extract_binaries
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start
```

---

## 3. Prepare the upgrade transaction

- In `poktroll_old`, run:

```bash
./tools/scripts/upgrades/prepare_upgrade_tx.sh v0.1.2
```

- Update the `height` in `tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json`:

```bash
# Get current height, add 20 (buffer)
CURRENT_HEIGHT=$(./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 q consensus comet block-latest -o json | jq '.sdk_block.last_commit.height' | tr -d '"')
UPGRADE_HEIGHT=$((CURRENT_HEIGHT + 20))
sed -i.bak "s/\"height\": \"[^\"]*\"/\"height\": \"$UPGRADE_HEIGHT\"/" tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json
cat ./tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json
```

---

## 4. Submit & verify the upgrade transaction

- In `poktroll_old`, submit:

```bash
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 tx authz exec tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json --yes --from=pnf
```

- Verify onchain:

```bash
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 query upgrade plan
```

---

## 5. Observe the upgrade output

- When `UPGRADE_HEIGHT` is reached, you should see output like:

```bash
ERR UPGRADE "v0.1.2" NEEDED at height: <height>: ...
```

- The validator should stop.

---

## 6. Stop old node & start new node

- In `poktroll_old`, stop the validator (`cmd + c` on macOS).
- In `poktroll_new`, start the validator:

```bash
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start
```

:::warning
If the new validator does not start, expert debugging is required.
:::

---

## 7. Sanity checks

- Check the new validator version:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:26657/abci_info | jq '.result.response.version'
```

- Should output: `v0.1.2`

:::note
Query the node for business logic changes as needed.
