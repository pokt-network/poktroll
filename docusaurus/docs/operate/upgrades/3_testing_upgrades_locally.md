## üì†üçù Testing Protocol Upgrades Locally: Step-by-Step <!-- omit in toc -->

**This contains step-by-step instructions for testing & validating protocol upgrades locally.**

- Every step is numbered and must be completed in order.
- If you find improvements, please update this doc.
- The current version of the doc is intended for testing two "finalized" releases. See the [advanced section](#advanced-fast-iteration-for-local-changes) for rapid iteration.

## 0. Prerequisite Notes

- Local environments **do not** support `cosmovisor`/automatic upgrades. This is fine for testing.
- This document shows how to test an upgrade locally using the `pocket_darwin_arm64` binary on a `macOS` machine with an `arm64` architecture. Adapt this to your environment.
- The example shows how to test an upgrade from `v0.1.1` ‚Üí `v0.1.2` assuming both of them already exist. Adapt this to your needs.

---

## 1. Start node with old version

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll.git pocket_old
cd pocket_old
git checkout v0.1.1
make go_develop ignite_release ignite_release_extract_binaries
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 comet unsafe-reset-all && make localnet_regenesis
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start
```

---

## 2. Release and extract new version node binaries

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pokt-network/poktroll.git pocket_new
cd pocket_new
gco v0.1.2
make go_develop ignite_release ignite_release_extract_binaries
```

---

## 3. Prepare the upgrade transaction

In `pocket_old`, the following file should already exist if you have completed the [Release Procedure](2_release_procedure.md):

```bash
tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json
```

It was created by running:

```bash
./tools/scripts/upgrades/prepare_upgrade_tx.sh v0.1.2
```

Open up a second shell in `pocket_old` and update the `height` in `tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json`:

```bash
# Get current height, add 20 (buffer)
CURRENT_HEIGHT=$(./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 q consensus comet block-latest -o json | jq '.sdk_block.last_commit.height' | tr -d '"')
UPGRADE_HEIGHT=$((CURRENT_HEIGHT + 20))
sed -i.bak "s/\"height\": \"[^\"]*\"/\"height\": \"$UPGRADE_HEIGHT\"/" tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json
cat ./tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json
```

---

## 4. Submit & verify the upgrade transaction

In `pocket_old`, submit the upgrade transaction:

```bash
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 tx authz exec tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json --yes --from=pnf
```

Verify it was submitted onchain:

```bash
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 query upgrade plan
```

---

## 5. Observe the upgrade output

When `UPGRADE_HEIGHT` is reached, you should see output like:

```bash
ERR UPGRADE "v0.1.2" NEEDED at height: <height>: ...
```

**üõë The validator should stop üõë**

---

## 6. Stop old node & start new node

- In `pocket_old`, stop the validator (`cmd/ctrl + c` on macOS).
- In `pocket_new`, start the validator:

```bash
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start
```

:::warning
If the new validator does not start, expert debugging is required.
:::

---

## 7. Sanity checks

- Check the new validator version:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:26657/abci_info | jq '.result.response.version'
```

- Should output: `v0.1.2`

:::note
Query the node for business logic changes as needed.

## [Advanced] Fast Iteration for Local Changes

:::danger This is rough and advanced

We will update and streamline this section in the future but use at your own risk for now

:::

### Setup (one time)

One time setup & preparation to test local changes.

**Old repo:**

```bash
# Checkout the previous release
git checkout v<previous_release_tag>

# Prepare the release
make release_tag_local_testing

# Rebuild the binary
make go_develop ignite_release_local ignite_release_extract_binaries

# Reset to genesis
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 comet unsafe-reset-all && make localnet_regenesis

# Start the binary
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start
```

**New repo:**

```bash
# Checkout the working feature branch
git checkout <working_feature_branch>

# Prepare the release
make release_tag_local_testing

# Update the upgrade
# CRUD `allUpgrades` in `app/upgrades.go`
# See TODO to manually update `pocket-local` in `NetworkAuthzGranteeAddress`

# Rebuild the binary
make go_develop ignite_release_local ignite_release_extract_binaries

# Start the binary
# ./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start
```

### Iterate (repeated)

The steps you'll be repeating many times through the process.

**Old repo:**

```bash
# Reset to genesis
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 comet unsafe-reset-all && make localnet_regenesis

# Start the binary
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start

# Update the upgrade height
CURRENT_HEIGHT=$(./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 q consensus comet block-latest -o json | jq '.sdk_block.last_commit.height' | tr -d '"')
UPGRADE_HEIGHT=$((CURRENT_HEIGHT + 20))
sed -i.bak "s/\"height\": \"[^\"]*\"/\"height\": \"$UPGRADE_HEIGHT\"/" tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_v0.1.2_local.json
cat ./tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_vX.Y.Z_local.json

# Submit the upgrade
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 tx authz exec tools/scripts/upgrades/upgrade_tx_vX.Y.Z_local.json --yes --from=pnf

# Stop the binary
```

**New repo:**

```bash
# Compile the binaries on every change/iteration
make go_develop ignite_release_local ignite_release_extract_binaries

# Start the binary after the release in the other one goes through
./release_binaries/pocket_darwin_arm64 start

# Test your changes
```
