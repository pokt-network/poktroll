## Background and Action Items for Exchanges

[Pocket Network](https://pocket.network) is migrating from Morse to Shannon (consensus-breaking, non-backwards-compatible upgrade) before the end of Q2.

**Exchanges must:**

- Update their integrations to the new version (hard fork).
- Maintain a full-node to the new network _OR_ use a Foundation-vendored RPC endpoint.
- Claim current `$POKT` token liquidity on the new network.

## What **IS** Changing?

### Accounts/Wallets

- Shannon uses the [Cosmos Cryptographic Key Scheme](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/beginner/accounts).
- New wallet required and manual claiming of tokens needed.

### Token Minting on Morse

- Snapshot block disables $POKT minting on Morse via governance transaction.
- Morse will stop functioning (no incentive for validators).

### Full Node Integration

- Integrate with new client:
  - [Full Node Cheatsheet](https://dev.poktroll.com/operate/cheat_sheets/full_node_cheatsheet)
  - Or get a Foundation-sponsored RPC endpoint from [Grove](https://portal.grove.city)

## Timeline

### 14-Day Migration Window

**Before Migration Window:**

- Disable deposits/withdrawals until migration is complete.
- Integrate with the pocket client (see above).
- Notify the Foundation in the shared Telegram group when these actions have been taken.

**After Migration:**

- Claim the tokens on the new network (see above).
- Re-enable deposits/withdrawals.
- Notify the Foundation in the shared Telegram group when these actions have been taken.

---

## Communication

- Each custodian should already have a Telegram group with Foundation & Grove personnel
- For reference, these personnel are located in the US-East timezone, and may therefor have a delayed response time.
- Use your group to ask questions or update on progress.

:::note Where to reach out?

Our assumption is that if you're reading this, you're already in touch with the Foundation team.

If not, please reach out to the community via discord at [https://discord.gg/pocket-network](https://discord.gg/pocket-network).
