## Terminology

- **Morse**: The *current* version of Pocket Network that your exchange is integrated with.
- **Shannon**: The *upcoming* version of Pocket Network that will replace Morse and become the new version of the chain.
- **Foundation**: The Pocket Network Foundation, which is responsible for the migration from an operational perspective.
- **Grove**: The official labs team for Pocket Network that is responsible for the migration from a technical perspective.

## Background

[Pocket Network](https://pocket.network) will undergo a major, consensus-breaking, non-backwards-compatible migration from Morse to Shannon before the end of Q2.

This migration will require exchanges to:

- Update their integrations to the new version of Pocket Network, which is billed in an upgrade, but technically and cryptographically, it is a hard fork.
- Maintain a full-node to the new network or use a Foundation-vendored RPC endpoint.
- Claim their current liquidiy of $POKT tokens on the new network.

## What **IS NOT** changing?

- The name: **Pocket Network**
- The ticker: **$POKT**
- Liquidity and State:
  - A snapshot of the state of the current version of Pocket Network (Morse) will occur within a 14-day migration window.
  - A 1:1 migration of liquidity and state from the snapshot will migrate over to the new version of Pocket Network (Shannon).
- Tokenomics:
  - At the end of April 2025, [we launched a mint = burn tokenomics model for Pocket Network](https://forum.pokt.network/t/protocol-economics-parameters-for-the-shannon-upgrade/5490). This requires manual burning of $POKT on a weekly basis, which can be tracked at [https://pokt.money](https://pokt.money).
  - After the migration, the new version of Pocket Network (Shannon) will burn tokens in real time.

## What **IS** changing? (And what you must do to prepare)

- **Accounts/Wallets**
  - Pocket Network's Shannon upgrade is switching to using the [Cosmos Cryptographic Key Scheme](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/learn/beginner/accounts).
  - This is different from the current key scheme used by Pocket Network and a new wallet must be created and manual claiming of tokens must occur.
- **Token Minting on Morse**
  - In the same block a snapshot is taken of liquidity and state on Morse, a governance transaction will be run to turn off minting of $POKT on Morse. This is to ensure accurate state preservation between Morse and Shannon.
  - Due to the lack of new token minting, the incentive to keep validators up to process Morse requests will be reduced and Morse will stop functioning.
- **Full Node Integration**
  - Integrate with the new Pocket Network client by using:
    - The [Full Node Cheatsheet](https://dev.poktroll.com/operate/cheat_sheets/full_node_cheatsheet).
    - Obtaining a Foundation-sponsored RPC endpoint to the new network from [Grove](https://portal.grove.city).

## Actions exchanges must take prior to the migration

- **Accounts/Wallets**
  - A new wallet must be created to interact with Pocket Network after the migration. Multiple options are available:
    - [pocketd CLI tool](https://dev.poktroll.com/explore/account_management/create_new_account_cli)
    - [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/)
    - [Soothe Vault](https://trustsoothe.io/)
- **Integrate with the new Pocket Network client**
  - The [Full Node Cheatsheet](https://dev.poktroll.com/operate/cheat_sheets/full_node_cheatsheet) to launch your own node.
  - Obtaining a Foundation-sponsored RPC endpoint to the new network from [Grove](https://portal.grove.city) by reaching out to Jinx or Arthur in your shared telegram group.
- Claiming Tokens
  - CLI Claiming
    - Claiming using the [pocketd CLI tool](https://dev.poktroll.com/explore/morse_migration/claiming_account)
  - UI Claiming

## Timeline

There will be a 14-day window prior to the migration where exchanges will need to do a handful of items.

### Before the Migration Window

- Disable deposits and withdrawals until the migration is complete.
- Integrate with the new Pocket Network client (see Actions section above).
- Notify the Foundation that you are prepared to migrate.

### After the Migration

- Claim tokens on the new network (see Claims Actions section above).
- Re-enable deposits and withdrawals.
- Notify the Foundation that you have completed the migration.

## Communication
- We have a telegram group with each exchange and all relevant Foundation and Grove personnel are in the US-East time zone. 
- Please reach out in our respective telegram group to ask questions or to notify us of your progress.
