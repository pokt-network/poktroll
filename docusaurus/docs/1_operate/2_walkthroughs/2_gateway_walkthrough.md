## What is PATH Gateway?

See the [PATH Gateway](https://path.grove.city) documentation for more
information on what a `PATH Gateway` is. This page aims to provide links and
details on how to deploy and operate it.

## PATH Gateway Operation Requirements

A PATH Gateway requires the following:

1. A staked onchain [Application](../../3_protocol/actors/2_application.md) to pay for services.
2. An optional onchain [Gateway](../../3_protocol/actors/3_gateway.md) to optionally proxy services.
3. A connection to a [Full Node](./../1_cheat_sheets/2_full_node_cheatsheet.md) to interact with the blockchain.

:::tip
It is crucial to deploy a [Full Node](./../1_cheat_sheets/2_full_node_cheatsheet.md) prior to setting up a RelayMiner.
This ensures the necessary infrastructure for blockchain communication is in place.

## Hardware requirements

Please see the [Hardware Requirements](../4_faq/6_hardware_requirements.md#path-gateway) page.

## Kubernetes Example
