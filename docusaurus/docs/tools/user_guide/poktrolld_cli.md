:::tip TL;DR If you know what you're doing

If you have `brew`:

```bash
brew tap pokt-network/poktroll
brew install poktrolld
```

If you don't have `brew`:

1. Grab a binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest)
2. Download the appropriate `poktroll_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz` for your environment
3. Untar the downloaded file to retrieve the `poktrolld` binary
4. Extract the binary to `/usr/local/bin`

or grab a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases).
