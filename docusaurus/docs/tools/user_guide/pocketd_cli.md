The source code for the Homebrew formula is available in the [homebrew-pocket](https://github.com/pokt-network/homebrew-pocket) repository.

If you encounter any issues, like being unable to install the latest version, you can try the following:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade pocketd
```

Or as a last resort, you can try the following:

```bash
brew tap --repair
brew untap pokt-network/poktroll
brew uninstall pocketd
brew tap pokt-network/poktroll
brew install pocketd
```

```

And verify it worked by running:

```bash
pocketd version
pocketd --help
