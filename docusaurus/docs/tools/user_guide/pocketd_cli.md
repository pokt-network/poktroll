### Using Homebrew (recommended)

Ensure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

<h3>Troubleshooting Homebrew</h3>
<p>
Read this section if you're having problems downloading or upgrading your `pocketd` binary using Homebrew.
</p>
</summary>

The source code for the Homebrew formula is available in the [homebrew-pocket](https://github.com/pokt-network/homebrew-pocket) repository.

If you encounter any issues, like being unable to install the latest version, you can try the following:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade pocketd
```

Or as a last resort, you can try the following:

```bash
brew tap --repair
brew untap pokt-network/pocket
brew uninstall pocketd
brew tap pokt-network/pocket
brew install pocketd
```

### Using release binaries (if you don't have brew)

:::tip tl;dr manual download

1. Grab a binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest)
2. Download the appropriate `pocket_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz` for your environment
3. Untar the downloaded file to retrieve the `pocketd` binary
4. Extract the binary to `/usr/local/bin`

curl -LO "https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases/latest/download/pocket_$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz"

# Extract the downloaded tarball to /usr/local/bin
sudo tar -zxf "pocket_$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz" -C /usr/local/bin

# Make the binary executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pocketd

# Check version
pocketd version
```
