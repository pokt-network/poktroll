* https://github.com/pokt-network/protocol-infra - a place where we describe Kubernetes infrastructure following GitOps pattern. ArgoCD consumes different manifests and provisions/maintains workloads using these manifests.
* https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll-docker-compose-example - an example of how to provision the poktroll stack using docker-compose. This includes Full Node, RelayMiner and AppGate Server. We provide instructions on how to stake the actors as well.
* https://github.com/pokt-network/helm-charts - helm charts that simplify deployment of our software on Kubernetes.
* https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-network-genesis - repository that includes genesis files for our networks.
