:::info GitHub Release vs Protocol Upgrade

Not every [GitHub release](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/releases) will become a protocol upgrade.

:::

Pocket Network is continuously evolving through regular protocol upgrades.

The DAO leads offchain governance and comes to agreement on upgrades through social consensus.

Validators support onchain `consensus-breaking` changes that were agreed on by the DAO offchain and triggered by PNF onchain. These upgrades can be automatically applied when using [Cosmovisor](../../1_operate/2_walkthroughs/1_full_node_binary.md), or manually if not using `cosmovisor`.

## What is a Protocol Upgrade?

A protocol upgrade updates Pocket Network's onchain software to:

- Add new features
- Improve existing functionality
- Fix critical issues

These keep the network secure, efficient, and up-to-date.

## Where to Find Upgrade Info

- [Upgrade List](4_upgrade_list.md): Info on each upgrade, including breaking changes and manual intervention requirements

## When is a Protocol Upgrade Needed?

| Update Type                              | Protocol Upgrade Required | GitHub Release Required | Consensus-Breaking | Example                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | :-----------------------: | :---------------------: | :----------------: | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Consensus-breaking changes**           |            Yes            |           Yes           |         ✅         | Changes to business logic in state machine |
| **State-breaking changes**               |            Yes            |           Yes           |         ✅         | Changes to protobufs and onchain state     |
| **Node (onchain) software release**      |  Optional (recommended)   |           Yes           |         ❌         | Performance improvements (no consensus)    |
| **Software (offchain) software release** |            No             |           Yes           |         ❌         | New CLI utilities                          |

:::info State vs Consensus Breaking Changes

All `state-breaking` changes are also `consensus-breaking` changes, but not all `consensus-breaking` changes are `state-breaking`.

## Protocol & Software Process Overview

When a `consensus-breaking` change is made to the protocol, we must carefully evaluate and implement an upgrade path that allows existing nodes to transition safely from one software version to another without disruption.

This process involves several key steps:

1. **Proposal**: The DAO drafts an upgrade proposal using our offchain governance system.
2. **Implementation**: The proposed changes are implemented in the codebase.
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of the proposed changes is conducted in devnet and testnet environments before mainnet deployment.
4. **Announcement**: Upon successful testing, we announce the upgrade through our social media channels and community forums.
5. **Deployment**: An upgrade transaction is sent to the network, allowing node operators using [Cosmovisor](../../1_operate/2_walkthroughs/1_full_node_binary.md) to automatically upgrade their nodes at the specified block height.
6. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment, we closely monitor the network to ensure everything functions as expected.

## Types of Upgrades

### Consensus Breaking vs. Non-breaking

- **Breaking:** All validators must upgrade to maintain consensus. Not upgrading may cause a chain split.
- **Non-breaking:** Backward compatible. No immediate validator action required.

### Planned vs. Unplanned

- **Planned:** Scheduled, communicated in advance (features, improvements, maintenance)
- **Unplanned:** Urgent, in response to bugs/security issues/chain halts/network congestion when no other mitigation is possible. May require manual intervention and can result in a hard fork.

### Manual Interventions

- Some upgrades require manual steps from node operators/validators.
- Always check upgrade notes for manual intervention requirements.

## Identifying Consensus-Breaking Changes

To identify `consensus-breaking` changes, review:

1. `consensus-breaking` label - Reviewing merged [Pull Requests (PRs) with the `consensus-breaking` label](https://github.com/pokt-network/poktroll/issues?q=label%3Aconsensus-breaking+) since the last release.
2. `.proto` files - Looking for breaking changes in protobufs
3. `x/` directories - Looking for breaking changes in the source code
4. `Parameters` - Identify new onchain parameters or authorizations

In situations where forking the network becomes necessary (such as in cases of non-deterministic chain state), we will issue an upgrade notice requiring manual intervention from users and/or validators to ensure the network's health and integrity.
